Giotto Cruise Phase Attitude History File                                     
-----------------------------------------                                     
                                                                              
1. Introduction                                                               
                                                                              
   This note provides details on the Giotto cruise phase attitude             
history file (GEXCPAHF). The full file was provided to the experimenters      
via a standard magnetic tape. The file format of GEXCPAHF is given in         
section 2.1. A printout of the attitude history file, covering the            
period 5 - 17 March 1986 is given in section 2.2.                             
                                                                              
2.1 File Details                                                              
                                                                              
   The experimenter cruise phase attitude history file contains records       
according to the content and format described in the Giotto Software          
Design Document, Annex C. It was intended that records would be provided      
only between two consecutive manoeuvres. However, it was decided to           
include additional records corresponding to fine attitude determination       
using the Giotto star mapper operating in star mode. Thus, in any period      
between two manoeuvres there could in general be more than one record         
containing the attitude details during free drift. Hence the GEXCPAHF         
provides a more finely sampled representation of the attitude history         
of Giotto.                                                                    
                                                                              
   The updated record format is given in Fig. 2.1                             
                                                                              
Notes:                                                                        
                                                                              
1) The start and stop times are UTC ground receive time.                      
                                                                              
2) The attitude is provided with respect to the spacecraft -z axis            
   (+ve spin-axis) in the mean equatorial system of B1950.                    
                                                                              
3) In any single given record the attitude refers to the attitude at          
   the start time specified in that record. Similarly, the spin-rate          
   provided also corresponds to the record start time.                        
                                                                              
4) It may be assumed that if the delta-V is exactly zero, and if              
   indicator flags F2 and F3 are both set to zero, then the attitude          
   etc. provided for that record corresponds to a period of free              
   drift, i.e. no manoeuvres have occurred.                                   
                                                                              
5) Default values of indicator flags F1, F2, F3 are zero.                     
                                                                              
6) During 5 - 17 March 1986, Giotto's geocentric distance increased           
   from about 139 million km to about 145 million km. The one-way             
   light time correspondingly increased from 7 mins 44 secs to                
   8 mins 04 secs. The event time on-board can be calculated by               
   subtracting the one-way light time from the ground receive time.           
   The spacecraft's geocentric distance, and hence light time, is             
   easily calculated from the orbital data.

N.B. The delta-V applies to a manoeuvre starting at the stop time of          
     validity and ending at the start time of the next record.                
                                                                              
2.2 Printout of GEXCPAHF                                                      
                                                                              
    A printout of GEXCPAHF is appended. Note the following:-                  
                                                                              
   1) At the encounter, i.e. over days 072/073, the Giotto attitude was       
      lost (due to loss of useful star mapper datation no attitude            
      determination was possible) shortly before the point of closest         
      approach to the comet and not recovered until several hours past        
      this point. The GEXCPAHF therefore contains the determined              
      attitude shortly before closest approach and then when the              
      spacecraft attitude was re-determinable.
