Mission: GIOTTO                                                               
Program: giodat.f                                                             
Submission: epgiotto.doc text file                                            
                                                                              
                                                                              
Original Format                                                               
                                                                              
	The original form of the source code for the FORTRAN subroutine,             
	GIODAT, and the attendant ephemeris data file, POSITION, were                
	received as part of the text file, epgiotto.doc.                             
                                                                              
Reformatting at SBN                                                           
                                                                              
	The following was done to access the subroutine:                             
	                                                                             
	 o The text file epgiotto.doc was edited to separate the parts               
	   which contained the ephemeris data file, POSITION, and the                
	   source code for the subroutine, GIODAT, into individual files             
	   for use.                                                                  
                                                                              
	 o The trailing control characters at the end of each line were              
	   removed so that the position data file could be used normally,            
	   and the subroutine, GIODAT could be compiled.                             
                                                                              
	 o A FORTRAN program, epgiotto.f, was then written to access the             
	   position data file via calls to GIODAT.                                   
                                                                              
	 o Numerous tests against known ephemeris data from various                  
	   sources were then done to test the accuracy of the values                 
	   returned by GIODAT.                                                       
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
Known Anomalies/Problems:                                                     
                                                                              
	 o Ephemeris data held in the data file POSITION, as stated in               
	   epgiotto.doc, are stored as double precision floating point               
	   numbers with 11 significant digits. However, GIODAT will only             
	   return values with 8 significant digits. Redefining the size              
	   of the variables read from POSITION by GIODAT would solve                 
	   this anomaly.                                                             
                                                                              
	 o GIODAT returns the position and velocity vectors for some                 
	   specified time, TUTC, in rectangular, barycentric, M.E.S.                 
	   1950 coordinates. Care must be taken when comparing to known              
	   sources that the proper conversions be made from the                      
	   coordinates used in the source to those of GIODAT.                        
                                                                              
	 o The velocity vectors for Comet Halley returned by GIODAT,                 
	   when compared to known data from the file ephem.tab, were                 
	   severely in error. It is still unknown why this is so.                    
                                                                              
	   The following chart is taken from the comparison of the output            
	   of GIODAT with the ephemeris values given in the file,                    
	   ephem.tab, on CDROM HAL_0019.
