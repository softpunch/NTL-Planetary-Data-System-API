  The RPA-Copernic plasma experiment for the Giotto mission consists of two Sen-                                                  
sors, the RPA1-EESA spectrometer and the RPA2-PICCA electrostatic mass analyzer.                                                  
RPA 1-EESA measures the three-dimensional distributions of electrons between 10 eV                                                
and 30 keV. These electron measurements should contribute to defining the properties                                              
of the cometary plasma and its interaction with the solar wind. The RPA-2 PICCA                                                   
sensor is an electrostatic mass analyzer designed to measure the composition and the                                              
distribution of thermal cometary positive ions, including clathrate hydrates in the mass                                          
range 10 to 203 amu. This instrument should probe the interaction processes produc-

position of the solid, gas and plasma components of the cometary environment. Such                                                
information should allow identification of parent molecules and hence give some                                                   
knowledge of the composition of the cometary nucleus.

  The RPA-Copernic experiment aboard Giotto is designed to measure the three-

hydrates, in the mass range 10 to 203 amu. It should help in achieving several of the                                             
major scientific objectives of the Giotto mission, by determining:

-   the chemical and physical nature of the comet's atmosphere and ionosphere                                                     
-   the chemical and physical structure of the comet's nucleus.                                                                   
                                                                                                                                  
The electron measurements should contribute to defining the structure of the cometary

electron measurements may provide detailed information on the magnetic-field struc-

  Before the comet encounter, the electron spectrometer should provide detailed infor-                                            
mation about the plasma in the interplanetary medium.                                                                             
  Positive ions are produced via various interactions between the comet nucleus, com-                                             
etary dust, micrometeoroids, cometary and solar-wind plasmas, neutral gas, and solar

to be present not only as free ions, but probably also as clathrate hydrates, i.e. bound

distribution close to the comet should provide a sensitive probe of these interaction                                             
processes, as well as information on the spatial distribution and composition of the                                              
solid, gas and plasma components of the cometary environment, and of the chemical

  The detailed scientific objectives of the experiment were described in Reme et al.                                              
(1981).

These instruments are mounted on the spacecraft's experiment platform in such a way                                               
that the field of view includes the ram direction.                                                                                
  The RPA-Copernic experiment is designed to:

   a large dynamic range, in the complete 4 pi solid angle, with high time resolution

    This sensor (Fig. 2) is designed to measure the fluxes and energy spectra of elec-                                            
trons from 10 eV to 30 keV in order to identify the various cometary plasma regions,                                              
to detect any heating or acceleration of particles, e.g. at shocks or in the cometary tail,                                       
and to observe any energetic electron population that can be significant for the ioniza-                                          
tion processes of the cometary plasma. RPA1-EESA has the ability to measure the                                                   
detailed 4 pi distributions of electrons in all regions of the cometary environment and                                           
to be sensitive to flows along either direction of an arbitrarily-oriented magnetic field                                         
in order to: (1) detect electrons travelling upstream and downstream of the cometary                                              
shocks and in this way provide a remote signal of the presence of the shock, (2)                                                  
measure any accelerated population in the shock structure, (3) use suprathermal elec-                                             
trons as remote probes or tracers of the magnetic-field topology and intensity (Ander-                                            
son et al., 1975; Lin et al., 1975). Because charged particles are reflected from                                                 
regions of stronger magnetic field, the range of electron energies covered by the in-                                             
strument and its pitch-angle resolution allow the detection of magnetic fields as low                                             
as 10**-1 nT. We note here that this technique is also applicable in the absence of a                                             
solid surface; for example, if the solar-wind field is compressed as it traverses the                                             
cometary ionosphere, incoming electrons must be reflected from the compressed                                                     
field region.

2.1 The analyzer                                                                                                                  
  The electrostatic analyzer detector system combines several recent innovations                                                  
which are particularly applicable to pitch-angle measurements. These innovations in-                                              
clude an improved electrostatic analyzer, a fast-counting particle-detection system,                                              
and a microprocessor-based data system. Our basic analyzer design is a symmetrical,                                               
spherical-section electrostatic analyzer with a uniform 360deg disc-shaped field of view                                          
and extremely fine angular-resolution capability, and is protected against dust con-                                              
tamination (Fig. 3). By comparison, there are several shortcomings in a conventional                                              
quadrispherical analyzer, which adversely affect pitch angle and three-dimensional                                                
plasma measurements: because this analyzer field of view is less than 180deg, there are                                           
always look directions that are not sampled, and as Gosling et al. (1978) have shown,                                             
its response in azimuth and polar angle is not constant, but becomes broader as the                                               
polar angle departs from normal incidence. These problems have been eliminated by                                                 
the new analyzer design used in RPA1-EESA, which is closely related to                                                            
quadrispherical analyzers, but has uniform response over 360deg of polar angle.

angle dependence and has a complete 360deg                                                                                        
field of view. Typical trajectories illustrate the                                                                                
focussing properties                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                  
  The operating principle of both analyzer types is illustrated by cross-section and top                                          
view in Figure 4. The normal quadrisphere consists of two concentric quarter-sphere                                               
sections, whereas the symmetric quadrisphere consists of three concentric spherical                                               
elements. These three elements are an inner hemisphere, an outer hemisphere which                                                 
contains a circular opening, and a smaller circular top cap which defines the entrance                                            
aperture. This analyzer is classified as quadrispheric, simply because the particles are                                          
deflected through 90deg. In both analyzers a potential is applied between the inner and                                           
outer plates and only charged particles having a limited range of energy and initial                                              
azimuth angle are transmitted. The particle exit position is a measure of the incident                                            
polar angle, which can be resolved by a suitable detector system. With a normal                                                   
quadrisphere, all particles entering at normal incidence focus to a line at the exit aper-                                        
ture, independent of where they cross the entrance aperture. Three paths with identical                                           
incident angle but different entrance positions are shown. For all oblique trajectories,                                          
the azimuthal response and polar angle focussing depend upon where the particles                                                  
cross the aperture. This property results directly from the lack of cylindrical symmetry                                          
of the planar entrance aperture. The symmetric quadrisphere circumvents this defect                                               
by making the entire analyzer, including the entrance aperture, rotationally sym-                                                 
metric. Again trajectories are shown to illustrate the focussing characteristics which                                            
are independent of the polar angle for the symmetric quadrisphere. The open character                                             
of the entrance aperture makes this symmetrical quadrisphere analyzer immune to both                                              
solar and cometary electromagnetic radiations and dust and neutral-gas contamination                                              
(fly-through). The acceptance fan is aligned to contain the spacecraft velocity vector                                            
so dust and neutral gas particles which pass through the collimator entrance continue                                             
through the analyzer top-cap region and pass out of the analyzer on the opposite side                                             
(Fig. 5).                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                  
  The electron detector provides a 360deg X4deg (FWHM) field of view with a uniform                                               
angular resolution of 22ù5deg X4deg. Due to the spacecraft spin, the aperture scans the full                                      
4 pi solid angle twice per revolution. It covers the energy range 10 eV - 30 keV with                                             
energy resolution Delta E/E ~ 10%.                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                  
2.2 Detector assembly                                                                                                             
  A schematic cross-section of the detection system and the scheme of the sectored                                                
collector are shown in Figure 6. Electrons passing through the entrance aperture of

voltage to the inner hemisphere of the analyzer. The selected electrons are detected                                              
by a microchannel plate (MCP) ring at the output. The MCP, specially made by                                                      
Mullard, is made up of two rings, each 1 mm thick with an external diameter of                                                    
86.6 mm and an internal diameter of 66 mm. Each ring has a Ni-Cr metallization on                                                 
the two-face active surface. The total resistance across a ring has a low value (between                                          
12 and 15 mega Ohm) for fast-counting purposes. The 12.5 micro m diameter, straight microchan-                                    
nels are inclined by 15deg and the two rings are chevron-mounted. The collector                                                   
associated with the MCP is divided into 17 sectors corresponding to 14 bins of 22.5deg,                                           
two bins of 19.5deg and one bin of 6deg linked to the ram direction. Hence, the angular                                           
position range is divided between 16 bins and the ram sector, and the 4 pi analysis using                                         
the rotation of the space probe is made with - 22.5deg X22.5deg elementary sectors.                                               
                                                                                                                                  
2.3 Energy sweep                                                                                                                  
  The energy selection of the detected electrons is made by varying the positive                                                  
deflection voltage of the inner hemisphere of the electrostatic analyzer. The outer                                               
hemisphere and the top cap are tied to signal ground. The variation of the deflec-                                                
tion voltage is synchronized with the spin period of the spacecraft, via the Sun                                                  
reference pulse. The sweep of the total energy range is repeated 16 times per spin,                                               
i.e. once every 250 ms. Since the 360deg field of view provides full coverage in 1/2 spin                                         
period, a full three-dimensional distribution with 22.5deg angular resolution is obtained                                         
in 2 s with eight energy sweeps. The deflection high-voltage range is stepped accor-                                              
ding to an exponential law, each step lasting 1.95 ms. For energies between 80 eV                                                 
and 30 keV, four high-voltage steps are used for one measurement, and for energies                                                
between 10 and 80 eV, only two high-voltage steps are used for one measurement.                                                   
Four steps are devoted to the high-voltage setting (Fig. 7). During one sweep, 23                                                 
measurements for energies greater than 80 eV and 16 measurements for energies                                                     
smaller than 80 eV are made, and a 39-step energy spectrum is therefore obtained                                                  
every 250 ms.                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                  
2.4 Electronics                                                                                                                   
  For each of the 17 angular bins, MCP signals are passed through individual charge-                                              
sensitive amplifiers to seventeen 16-bit counters. A digital front-end system                                                     
preprocesses the accumulated counts in order to obtain corrected data, taking into ac-                                            
count the dead time of the detectors. Electron data are accumulated into 17 angle bins,                                           
for every energy, eight times per half spin, and stored in RAM by a main processor.                                               
At the end of each half-spin interval, the corrected data are transferred to a pitch-angle                                        
calculator for further processing and results from the previous half spin are sent back                                           
to the main processor.

  The way the three microprocessors work together and how they interface with the                                                 
analogue electronics and with the spacecraft is shown in Figure 9.                                                                
  All experiment timing, such as energy sweeping and angle binning, are synchro-                                                  
nized via the spacecraft Sun reference pulse and generated from the spin-segment

2.5 Onboard data processing                                                                                                       
  The measurements are accumulated in a memory and passed through a data-                                                         
processing unit in order to lower the output data range.                                                                          
  As the complete 10 eV to 30 keV electron distribution function over 4 pi can be                                                 
achieved at each half rotation of the spacecraft, i.e. every 2 s, the amount of informa-                                          
tion available for every distribution is: 17 sectors (theta) X 8 azimuths (phi) X 39 energy                                       
bands (E) = 5304 counts termed CR(theta(i), phi(i), E(k)). These are the input counts (dead-                                      
time corrected) corresponding to the 39 energy bands analyzed and the 17 angular sec-                                             
tors (16 sectors + ram sector); the 8 azimuths correspond to the sweeping of the high                                             
voltage, which lasts one eighth of a rotation (250 ms), which means 8 sweeps in 2 s.                                              
  With 8 bit words, there would have to be 5304X8=42 432 bits,i.e. 21 216 bit/s.                                                  
It is not possible to transmit such an amount of information through the telemetry and                                            
therefore onboard processing is necessary.                                                                                        
  This onboard processing must be adapted to the spacecraft real-time telemetry                                                   
system, which has three different formats for science-data transmission: telemetry                                                
Formats 1, 2 and 3 (see Section 4). Formats 1 and 2 can be operated at high bit rate                                              
(HBR = total spacecraft bit rate 46 kbit/s) or at half the maximum bit rate (low bit                                              
rate = LBR). Independently, the RPA-Copernic data packet lasts 16 s (HBR) or 32 s                                                 
(LBR). In LBR the same data are produced, but only from every other spin (Fig. 7).                                                
  The calculations carried out by RPA1-EESA are the following:                                                                    
-   an estimate of the magnetic-field direction, which is computed from two                                                       
    partial-pressure tensors calculated in two distinct electron energy ranges: in                                                
    telemetry Formats 3 and 2/2, range 1 is between 3.64 and 0.36 keV and range                                                   
    2 between 0.36 and 0.08 keV; in telemetry Formats 1 and 2/1, range 1 is between                                               
    3.64 and 0.28 keV, and range 2 between 0.28 and 0.08 keV                                                                      
-   the Pitch Angle Distribution (PAD) determination of the electron in the 0-180deg                                              
    range in eight bins, for several energy bands                                                                                 
-   the Omni Directional Energy Spectrum (ODES) for each E-value:                                                                 
                                                                                                                                  
    ODES (E(k)) = Summation(i,j) CR(theta(i), phi(j), E(k)) (for i = 0-15 and j = 0-7).                                           
                                                                                                                                  
    For energies E > 80 eV (steps 1 to 23) and steps 24, 26,28 and 30, the calcula-                                               
    tions are made by the PAD Processor (ODES-B). The calculations for the other                                                  
    steps are made by the main calculator (ODES-A)                                                                                
-   the Low Energy Distribution (LED): in order to search for possible azimuthal                                                  
    anisotropies in the distributions of low-energy electrons (E <80 eV), thereby                                                 
    allowing the possible effects of the asymmetries in spacecraft potential or of                                                
    predominant streaming directions to be seen, snapshots of the azimuthal distribu-                                             
    tions are regularly calculated and transmitted. A snapshot is performed in 4 s                                                
    using one half of the MCP. The next snapshot is performed using the second half                                               
    of the MCP. Thus, a complete spacecraft rotation is necessary to obtain the snap-                                             
    shot corresponding to all azimuths (16 sectors phi). In the case where there are two                                          
    snapshots per data packet (Formats 2/1 and 2/2), they are performed with the                                                  
    same half of the MCP:                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                  
    LED (phi(j), E(k)) = Summation(i) CR(theta(i), phi(j), E(k))     (for i = 0-7 or i = 8-15).                                   
                                                                                                                                  
    In Format 2/2, this calculation is also performed for energies E> 80 eV and is                                                
    then called the ED (Energy Distribution).                                                                                     
-   2s snapshots of the Distribution Function (DF) are transmitted frequently.                                                    
    Beyond their scientific interest, they also permit the validity of the preceding                                              
    calculations (principally PAD) to be verified. However, these snapshots are not                                               
    the most elementary distribution function: the ram and the 128 angular bins                                                   
    sampled are grouped on only 89 solid angles, following the principle outlined                                                 
    below.                                                                                                                        
    As the directions along the spin axis are oversampled, the high-elevation                                                     
    azimuthal sectors are grouped, whereas the low-elevation ones are transmitted                                                 
    individually. The Distribution Function can be transmitted for selected energy                                                
    steps or summed over several consecutive steps                                                                                
-   in several bands (of one or more energy steps), the maximum count rate in a                                                   
    spacecraft half-rotation is searched for. The azimuthal as well as the elevation                                              
    position of this maximum and the corresponding flux are transmitted. For several

The operation of the different telemetry formats is given in detail in Section 4.                                                 
  These data are compressed from 21 bits to 8 bits, according to a special algorithm,                                             
such that the precision is always better than 3.3% if the count rate is between 32 and

2.6 The Pitch Angle Distribution processor                                                                                        
  The Pitch Angle Distribution (PAD) processor is designed to sort the three-                                                     
dimensional electron distribution data generated by the RPA1-EESA detector into two-                                              
dimensional pitch-angle distributions in real time.                                                                               
  The PAD processor hardware consists of an NSC800 CMOS microprocessor                                                            
together with hardware multiply/divide, ROM, and a pair of dual-ported RAMs. The                                                  
RPA main processor controls and communicates with the PAD processor via the dual-                                                 
ported RAMs.                                                                                                                      
  The PAD partial processor computes the PAD in three steps: first, it computes two                                               
partial-pressure tensors from the input data over two separate energy ranges (Eqn. 1).                                            
Next, each of these tensors is diagonalized under the assumption that the distribution                                            
has a two-dimensional symmetry, and the nondegenerate eigenvector is computed.                                                    
This vector corresponds to the symmetry direction of the distribution, which is                                                   
presumably the magnetic-field direction. Finally, the three-dimensional input data is                                             
sorted into a two-dimensional PAD using the computed symmetry direction for each                                                  
energy range (Eqn.2).                                                                                                             
  Pitch-angle distributions of eight angles, summed into 10 or 16 energy steps, are                                               
computed every half spin (2s).                                                                                                    
  The equations used in the computations are:

and to be highly collimated in the direction opposite to the spacecraft ram direction.                                            
The kinetic energy of these particles will be given approximately by E(kev)

mass in amu.                                                                                                                      
  The Giotto space probe is expected to traverse the inner coma in a rather short time,                                           
so that the main observations performed by the RPA2-PICCA sensor will begin 15                                                    
min before the closest approach of the spacecraft to Comet Halley. In the inner part                                              
of the cometary coma the density, and therefore the flux of positively charged par-                                               
ticles is expected to be rather high (~ 10**3 cm**-3), and at the same time to be accom-                                          
panied by a very high flux of 'background radiation'. In the case of the RPA2-PICCA                                               
experiment, this background could be caused by one or several of the following com-                                               
ponents: solar and cometary electromagnetic radiation, incoming dust, neutral gas and                                             
sputtered fragments due to collisions of these particles in the analyzer itself, energetic                                        
electrons, high fluxes of positive ions interacting with the spacecraft and/or the outer                                          
parts of the sensor, and any kind of particles surrounding the spacecraft due to dust-                                            
micrometeoroid-neutral gas and cometary plasma interactions with the space probe.                                                 
  To cope with these constraints and at the same time obtain as large an amount of                                                
significant information as possible, the RPA2-PICCA sensor has been optimized in the                                              
following way. As Figure 12 shows, the main part of this experiment is mounted                                                    
behind the backup shield or the second bumper shield, but inside the spacecraft. Only                                             
its entrance aperture, which is a 50X50X 150 mm**3 tube, is outside of the spacecraft,                                            
but it is attached directly to the spacecraft skin and has a large (+/-6deg) unobstructed                                         
field of view in the flight direction of the probe. This aperture is completely open,                                             
so that light, micrometeoroids, dust and neutral gas can fly through without                                                      
penetrating the analyzer system. In addition, the field of view of the analyzer itself is                                         
chosen in such a way that it never intersects any part of the aperture, nor the spacecraft                                        
skin or shields, but at the same time is still large enough (+/-5deg) to accept all particles                                     
to be analyzed, even in cases where their trajectories may differ, due to additional ther-                                        
mal speed of the ions, slight changes in the speed and orientation of the spacecraft,                                             
or electrostatic potentials of the space probe. Thus, any kinds of fragments originating                                          
from dust, neutral- or charged-particle interaction with the spacecraft and aperture                                              
materials is precluded from entering the analyzer system.                                                                         
  As with RPA2-PICCA, a mass analysis of positive ions and their clathrate hydrates                                               
will be performed in the mass range 10-203 amu: their kinetic energy will be up to                                                
about 5 keV. By applying a steadily increasing deflection voltage (+ HV) between the                                              
top and the bottom parts of the aperture, the particles will therefore be deflected from                                          
the incoming flow direction into the analyzer system. This analyzer is a 180deg                                                   
hemispherical electrostatic analyzer, which focusses the particles onto two chan-                                                 
neltrons with different sensitive areas in order to increase the dynamic range of the                                             
instrument. The overall dynamic range covers ion densities from 10**-3 to 10**3

etary nucleus, as determined by Huebner & Giguere (1980) by multidimensional                                                      
computer simulations, lie within the dynamic range of RPA2-PICCA.                                                                 
  According to the equation E(keV) ~/= k*N*V**2 mentioned above, any energy/charge                                                
(E/Q) measurement of this analyzer will actually be a measurement of the mass of the                                              
particle, as Q=1. To obtain a good and constant mass resolution, the ions are                                                     
decelerated before entering the electrostatic analyzer: ions with masses 10 to 50 will                                            
have energies after this deceleration of 100 eV, and ions with masses 51 to 203,                                                  
250 eV. Using an analyzer with Delta E/E ~/= 10% and operating at two different fixed                                             
voltages for the two mass ranges, we obtain Delta E = 10 eV and Delta m ~/= 0.4 for the light                                     
ions and Delta E = 25 eV and Delta m ~/= 1 for the heavier ions.

  The electronics used within the RPA2-PICCA instrument are shown in Figure 13.                                                   
All high voltages required for the deflection system, lens system, electrostatic analyzer                                         
and the two channeltrons are generated within the sensor, so that there are no high-                                              
voltage lines between the two RPA-Copernic instruments. The electronics also include                                              
one test generator (100 kHz) and one ultraviolet lamp to test the functions of the                                                
amplifiers and the channeltrons.                                                                                                  
  A small negative voltage (-10 V) is applied to the outer part of the sensor in order                                            
to repel the secondary electrons of the plasma cloud around the spacecraft, which                                                 
would otherwise be captured by the positive deflection voltage.                                                                   
                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                  
3.2 Associated digital electronics                                                                                                
  The electronics associated with RPA2-PICCA are included in the RPA1-EESA box,                                                   
and are organized around a CDP 1802 microprocessor. These electronics are used to                                                 
control operation of the RPA2-PICCA detector according to telemetry format and the

-   high-voltage stepping                                                                                                         
-   test generator on/off                                                                                                         
-   UV lamp on/off.                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                  
Synchronously with this task, this microprocessor acquires data from two 16-bit                                                   
counters, one for the larger CEM and one for the smaller. These data are compressed                                               
from 16 bit to 8 bit, according to a special algorithm, such that the precision is always                                         
better than 1.2% if the count rate is lower than 255, and better than 3.3% if the count                                           
rate is between 255 and 65535. Every 16 s a packet of data is generated and is sent                                               
to the telemetry by using a DMA interface. The high-voltage analyzer is monitored                                                 
through an 8-bit analogue-to-digital converter. The step number and corresponding                                                 
control voltage are included in the scientific data stream.

4. Modes of Operation                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                  
  The initial Giotto telemetry was divided into two formats to allow plasma ex-                                                   
periments to get more data far from the nucleus. A third reduced format (Format 3)                                                
was also added in order to have some cruise measurements and as complete as                                                       
possible coverage during the last days before the closest approach to the comet                                                   
nucleus.                                                                                                                          
  The telemetry allocation for the RPA-Copernic experiment is as follows: 904 bit/s                                               
in Format 3, 2530 bit/s in Format 1, 1807 bit/s in Format 2. Format 2 will be used                                                
from t(0)-1 hour (t(0) = time of closest approach) until mission end. Format 1 will be                                            
used from t(0)-4 h until t(0)-1 h. Prior to that, Formats 1 and 3 will be used in order                                           
to obtain complete coverage of the last 24 h before the closest approach to the nucleus                                           
and significant coverage during the last five days.                                                                               
  An internal RPA-Copernic switch in Format 2, 15 min before t(0) will modify bit                                                 
distribution between the two sensors (Formats 2/1 and 2/2). Tables 3,4,5 and 6 give                                               
summaries of the measurements and telemetered data for each format (in HBR for For-                                               
mats 1, 2/1 and 2/2).                                                                                                             
  RPA2-PICCA is used mainly in the Format 2/2 (encounter phase). Its cycle of                                                     
measurement is 3.2 s, i.e. less than one spin period, avoiding the analysis of the same                                           
masses always in the same sector. This sensor is not used in Format 3 and is in a                                                 
survey mode in Formats 1 and 2/1.

are summarized in Table 7. The experiment operated successfully for the first time                                                
in September 1985. RPA2-PICCA is working well, but is not designed to study solar-                                                
wind ions, and is therefore not useful during the cruise phase prior to encounter with                                            
Comet Halley. RPA1-EESA is regularly providing fine data on the electrons in the                                                  
interplanetary medium. Figures 14 and 15 show examples of results obtained on day                                                 
289 in 1985. Figure 14 contains 5 h of measurements of the interplanetary B-field                                                 
direction and of the electron density. Figure 15 is an example of the electron Low                                                
Energy Distribution (LED) obtained over one spacecraft spin period (4 s).                                                         
  Hence, these two sensors, specially designed for the Giotto mission, are ready to                                               
study the solar wind - Comet Halley interaction and the environment of the comet                                                  
nucleus on 13 March 1986. The electron and ion measurements should help to define                                                 
the basic structure of the cometary plasma, and provide a sensitive diagnosis of the                                              
interactions between the various components of the cometary environment: solar                                                    
wind, cometary plasma, micrometeoroids, cometary dust, the nucleus, neutral gas,                                                  
electrons and ions.                                                                                                               
 In addition, important information on the composition of comets should be obtained                                               
which, in combination with that from other experiments, should help us to define the                                              
chemical and physical nature of comets.
