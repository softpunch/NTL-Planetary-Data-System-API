    The Giotto Radio Science Experiment data set consists                     
    of four tables.  Each table contains a measurement                        
    value listed as a function of time.  The measurements                     
    are: closed-loop receiver carrier signal amplitude,                       
    closed-loop receiver carrier frequency residual,

     The measurements of frequency and frequency residual                     
    may be converted to changes in spacecraft velocity                        
    during the Halley encounter.  The changes in velocity                     
    may then be interpreted in terms of mass fluence

=========================                                                     
                                                                              
      The maximum frequency offset in the one-way data                        
      was 16.9 Hz.  But the two-way data acquired before                      
      and after the encounter are consistent with a                           
      maximum of only 4.64 Hz.                                                
                                                                              
      Two explanations have been offered                                      
      [EDENHOFERETAL1987B].  First is that the drag                           
      forces amplified the oscillator drift through                           
      acoustic, electrical, or thermal energy deposition.                     
      In this case, the measurements differ from the                          
      actual values by only a scale factor.  The analysis                     
      presented by [EDENHOFERETAL1987B] adopts this                           
      assumption.                                                             
                                                                              
      The second explanation is that transients during                        
      the encounter (possibly associated with failure of                      
      the NMS experiment and switching of the TWT                             
      amplifier tubes) also induced a frequency offset in                     
      the on-board oscillator.  In this case, both an                         
      offset and a scale factor may be needed to correct                      
      the data.                                                               
                                                                              
      No applicable pre-launch tests were conducted on
