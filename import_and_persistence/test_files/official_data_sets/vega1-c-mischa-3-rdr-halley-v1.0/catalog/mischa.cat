      The magnetometer (MISCHA)                                               
      The prime objective of the magnetometer experiment is                   
      to determine the role of the magnetic field in the                      
      interaction between the solar wind and the comet and                    
      to identify the characteristic boundaries of the                        
      cometary environment (bow shock, contact surface,                       
      etc.).

      The sensors of the MISCHA magnetometer are mounted on                   
      a boom. A single-axis sensor and a triaxial sensor                      
      are mounted 1 and 2 m, respectively, from the                           
      edge of the solar panel. The advantage of this                          
      dual-sensor fluxgate system is the possibility to                       
      determine the spacecraft's stray magnetic field.
