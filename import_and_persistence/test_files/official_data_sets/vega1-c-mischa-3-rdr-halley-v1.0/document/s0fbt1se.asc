1. ABSTRACT                                                                   
-----------                                                                   
                                                                              
The S*FBT1SE file of the magnetic field data, measured by the MISCHA -        
experiment on board of the Vega spacecraft, contains the following            
types of data: the position of the spacecraft in heliocentric (solar) ecliptic
coordinates (H.SE), magnetic field data in a coordinate system centered at the
spacecraft with x - axis to the sun and (x,y) - plane in its orbital plane    
(i.e. almost equal to the ecliptic plane), z approx. to ecliptic northpole.   
In addition, quality flags give information about missing or bad data.        
                                                                              
                                                                              
The magn. field data in these filse are collected from FOUR different modes:  
- for some time intervals (around closest approach), data are available with  
  high time resolution (DT or 1 vector/(0.1 sec));                            
- for other intervals, data are available in HS mode = 1 vector/(6 sec);      
- for other intervals, data are available in T2 mode = 1 vector/(60 sec);     
- for other intervals, data are available in T1 mode = 1 vector/(150 sec).    
                                                                              
Data have been AVERAGED down to a common resolution of 150 sec.               
So the whole file has an EQUAL time resolution of 1 vector/(150 sec).         
The times were have been averaged are in the header, in the list of intervals 
marked with DT, HS, T2.                                                       
                                                                              
H.SE - coordinate system: Heliocentric ecliptic coord. system:                
positions of the SC are given in this co. system: x-axis to equinox 1950.,    
z-axis to ecliptic northpole, (x,y)-plane is the ecliptic plane.              
                                                                              
SE - coordinate system: Solar Ecliptic system:                                
spacecraft-centered, x-axis to sun, (xy)-plane is orbital plane of spacecraft,
i.e. nearly equal to the ecliptic plane, z-axis nearly to ecliptic pole.
