Mass: 2.2 kg

Date built: 1985

               Hungary                                                        
                                                                              
TUNDE-M consists of two particle telescopes: T1 is viewing at 55 deg to the   
east of the Sun, T2 looks at 90 deg to the east of the Sun, both in the       
ecliptic plane.                                                               
                                                                              
The scientific objective was to study the high energy (from about 50 keV      
to 700 keV) ion environment of comet Halley. Ions (probably mostly water      
group) were successfully observed (for details, see Somogyi et al. Nature

Calibrations: electronic calibrations  were  performed  only,  the            
results were used to determine the relative width of the ion energy           
channels and from this to obtain the real values of the energy                
limits of the channels starting from the nominal values.                      
                                                                              
The instrument was mounted to point in a fixed direction relative to the      
spacecraft.

TUNDE-M consists of two particle telescopes: T1 is viewing at 55 deg to the   
east of the Sun, T2 looks at 90 deg to the east of the Sun, both in the       
ecliptic plane. The telescopes consist of two circular surface barrier        
semiconductor detectors with an Al layer of 15x10^-6 g/cm2 coated on the      
front detector (A) and an anticoincidence scintillation detector MCP.         
Low energy electrons (below about 160 keV) were deflected with a magnet.      
Field of view (half cone): 25 deg. Geometric factor: 0.25 cm^2 sr.            
Particles stopping in the thin front detector were not identified (they       
are referred as ion channels), those reaching the thick detector were         
identified via the dE/E method.                                               
                                                                              
T1 was working all along the mission, T2 was rendered inoperative before      
the Halley encounter.                                                         
                                                                              
Modes of operation: Trassa-1 and Trassa-2 (cruise phase) and BRL (fast        
telemetry, started at 04:17:03 UT, March 6, 1986, ended at 08:24:53 UT,       
same day). Data were gathered in 66 channels, some referred as ions,          
others as identified particles, both between preset energy limits (given      
at the data set description).                                                 
                                                                              
Data rate: 1 frame of 66 real numbers in every 4 s (BRL mode).                
The measurement was continuous, with an integration time of 4 s.

DATA SET                                                                      
                                                                              
The data were measured during the BRL seance on 6 March 1986.                 
The data are listed as 62 records long blocks (time and                       
61 energy channels), blocks were obtained in every 4 s.                       
                                                                              
The structure of the blocks is the following:                                 
1st record - time in sec at the end of integration. To obtain the spacecraft  
time in UT, one has to add 4h 16m 59s to that number.                         
2nd to 62nd records (integer numbers): counts/4 s in the energy channels      
listed below (in channels 5 to 57 - from 6th to 58th record - the energies    
depend on the identity of the particles, they are given below both            
for protons and oxygen ions in keVs):
