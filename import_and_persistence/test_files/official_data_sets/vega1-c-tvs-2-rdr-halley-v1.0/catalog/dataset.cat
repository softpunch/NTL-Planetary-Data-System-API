      - The IKI datasets header have a field called                           
      CRVAL3 which appears to contain a count of seconds                      
      since midnight.                                                         
                                                                              
      - We converted the CRVAL3 value to a day fraction                       
      and matched patterns of exposure times between this                     
      dataset and similar TVS data from KFKI.                                 
                                                                              
      - the IKI time is greater than the KFKI time for                        
      the corresponding dataset by about 0.00646 days                         
      (approximately 9.3 minutes).  (We interpret the                         
      latter as the light correction time but choose not
