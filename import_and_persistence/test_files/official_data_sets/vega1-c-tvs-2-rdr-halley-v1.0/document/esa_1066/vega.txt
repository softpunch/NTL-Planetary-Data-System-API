1.  Introduction                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                  
A unique opportunity to combine missions to Venus and Comet Halley is available                                                   
in 1985-1986 by employing a two-element space vehicle consisting of a Venus lander                                                
and a Halley flyby probe. This mission is being conducted by the USSR with the                                                    
cooperation of a number of other countries.                                                                                       
   Two spacecraft, Vega-1 and Vega-2*, have been launched aboard Proton                                                           
rockets from Baykonour (Kazhakstan), on 15 and 21 December 1984, respectively.                                                    
The two spacecraft are identical and the 'redundancy' is aimed at increasing the                                                  
overall reliability of the scientific mission. In June 1985, the landers were separated                                           
from the Halley probes in the vicinity of Venus. They were injected into the planet's                                             
atmosphere to perform measurements until after surface impact. During their descent,                                              
the landers each released a balloon, to drift in the planet's atmosphere. These balloons                                          
were tracked with the help of an international Very-Long-Baseline Interterometry                                                  
(VLBI) network.                                                                                                                   
   After relaying the lander telemetries towards the Earth, the Halley probes con-                                                
tinued their journey towards the comet, following an orbital correction and a gravita-                                            
tional manoeuvre around Venus. The cometary flyby will occur in the period 6-12                                                   
March 1986, at distances of the order of 10,000 km from the nucleus and with a                                                    
relative velocity of 78 km/s.                                                                                                     
   One of the Vega programme's aims was study of Venus' atmospheric composition                                                   
and circulation, clouds and planetary surface. This article, however, is devoted entire-                                          
ly to the second aim of the mission, the exploration of Comet Halley.                                                             
   The scientific objectives of the Vega cometary investigation are:                                                              
(i)  determination of the physical parameters of the nucleus: dimensions, shape,                                                  
     temperature and surface properties                                                                                           
(ii) study of the structure and dynamics of the coma around the nucleus                                                           
(iii)  definition of the gas composition in the close vicinity of the nucleus and the                                             
     nature of the parent molecules                                                                                               
(iv)  study of the dust particles' composition and mass distribution as functions of the                                          
     distance to the nucleus, and                                                                                                 
(v)  study of the interaction of the solar wind with the atmosphere and ionosphere                                                
     of the comet.                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                  
The Halley probes are three-axis-stabilized and their orientation will be defined with                                            
an accuracy of 1deg during Halley flyby. The optical instruments are mounted on a point-                                          
ing platform which can track the nucleus with an angular accuracy of the order of                                                 
5 arcmin. The other instruments are mounted on the main structure of the probes. The                                              
data are transmitted via two independent telemetry links, with capacities of 3072 bit/s                                           
and 65 536 bit/s, respectively. Each Halley probe carries a complement of 14 ex-                                                  
periments, which are listed in Table 1.                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                  
2. The scientific payload                                                                                                         
2.1 Television system (TVS)                                                                                                       
 The purpose of the television system (TVS) is to detect the cometary nucleus,                                                    
measure its dimensions and albedo, and study the structure and dynamics of the central                                            
part of the coma. This instrument also constitutes the sensor for the servo-system that                                           
controls the motion of the pointing platform, on which it is mounted together with the                                            
two other optical instruments (IKS and TKS).                                                                                      
 The television system consists of two telescopes, one narrow-angle camera (TVY)                                                  
for high-resolution imaging of the nucleus, and one large-angle camera (TDN) for                                                  
detecting and tracking the comet (Fig. 1). The TVY optics have a reflecting objective                                             
with a focal length of 1200 mm and a detector which yields an average angular                                                     
resolution of 3 arcsec, i.e. a spatial resolution of the order of 150 m at the nominal                                            
flyby distance of 10,000 km. The maximum angular dimension of the nucleus and its                                                 
near environment is expected to be 5 arcmin at closest approach, and the pointing                                                 
error is estimated to be +/- 5 arcmin. The field of view of the TVY must therefore be                                             
not less than 15 arcmin.

words Venera (Venus) and Gallei (Halley)                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                  
 The TDN has a refractory objective with a focal length of 150 mm. It is                                                          
characterized by an angular resolution of 0.5 arcmin, required for early acquisition of                                           
the comet and its nucleus, and a 2deg field of view imposed by the constraints associated                                         
with control of the pointing platform.                                                                                            
  The light collected by each telescope is divided into two paths by a beam splitter.                                             
One channel is fitted with a fixed filter, the other has a set of eight filters mounted                                           
on a rotating wheel, to yield a spectral analysis of the signal. The images are formed                                            
on area CCDs cooled by a passive radiator regulated by a Peltier plate. The                                                       
commutable filters of the TDN have an additional function, namely to adjust the                                                   
amount of light collected by the detector. This channel is operated autonomously and                                              
performs an independent analysis of the video signal, thus providing redundant                                                    
information to the platform pointing system for the sake of reliability.                                                          
  The signals delivered by the three other TDN and TVY channels are handled by the                                                
same microprocessor system which analyzes the images and generates the commands                                                   
that control the motion of the platform.                                                                                          
  The TVS electronics include a 816 kbit memory to store both data and programs.                                                  
The main characteristics of the TVS are given in Table 2.

2.2 The infrared spectrometer (IKS)                                                                                               
  The infrared spectrometer is designed to study the radiation from the inner coma,                                               
in the wavelength range 2.5-12 micro m. The instrument includes two high-resolution                                               
spectral channels for the chemical analysis of the cometary matter, gas and dust, and                                             
an image modulation channel for determination of the size of and thermal emission                                                 
from the nucleus.                                                                                                                 
  The light that exits from the telescope is divided into three by means of two beam-                                             
splitters. The secondary beams are then focussed on a wheel that rotates at the rate                                              
of 8 rev/sec and carries three rings, namely two circular variable filters and one image                                          
modulator. Behind the encoding wheel, the beams enter a cryostat which cools the                                                  
three detectors (Fig. 2).                                                                                                         
  The two filters cover the ranges 2.5-5 micro m and 6-12 micro m, which include the                                              
emission bands of the parent molecules. The long-wave channel can detect water ice                                                
and the short-wave channel can be used to identify a number of minerals, such as                                                  
silicates. The imaging channel does not resolve details of the nucleus, the objective                                             
being to derive its most important parameters, size, shape, temperature and optical                                               
properties in the infrared. To accommodate the nucleus pointing uncertainties, a field                                            
of view of 1deg is judged necessary and an angular resolution of 1 arcmin satisfactory.                                           
More instrument characteristics are given in Table 3.                                                                             
  Since the sensitivity of the instruments is degraded by four to five orders of                                                  
magnitude between 77 K and room temperature, it appears mandatory to cool the                                                     
detectors during the two measuring sequences using the Joule-Thomson expansion of                                                 
nitrogen. For that purpose, 2 l of nitrogen are stored in four tanks at a pressure of                                             
350 atm. The detector temperatures reach stability within 25 min (to +/- 0.1deg) and can                                          
be maintained so for 3 h.                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                  
2.3 The three-channel spectrometer (TKS)                                                                                          
  The objectives of the three-channel spectrometer are to define the chemical                                                     
composition of the cometary coma and tail, to identify the polarization and spectrum                                              
of the light component diffused by the dust, to detect the primary molecules, and to                                              
obtain the spectral signature of the nucleus and its environment.

  The TKS instrument includes a Cassegrain refractory telescope. The secondary                                                    
mirror can be tilted about two axes in increments of 8 arcmin. It covers a field of                                               
2deg x 1.5deg, equivalent to an area of 350x260 km**2 at a distance of 10**4 km. The                                              
spectral map is made up of 7 lines and each line consists of 15 locations. The                                                    
measurement cycle at each location lasts 5 s, so that a complete spectral map is taken                                            
every 8 min 45 s. Three slits located in the focal plane of the objective form the                                                
beams which enter the three channels of the spectrometer, as illustrated in Figure 3.                                             
 The visible and ultraviolet channels are similar and symmetrically arranged. A                                                   
holographic diffracting array makes a spectral image of the entrance slit on a                                                    
photocathode system. The electron flows delivered by the elements of the                                                          
photocathode are first amplified by four orders of magnitude and subsequently                                                     
accelerated to an energy of several keV before impacting on a luminescent screen.                                                 
Optical fibres then transfer the spectrum from the screen to a linear CCD. Each                                                   
channel delivers a spectrum of 700 points every 5 s.                                                                              
 The UV measurements provide information about the fluorescence spectra of a                                                      
number of atoms, radicals and ions, whereas the visible channel gives the spectrum                                                
of the light diffused by the dust and the nucleus.                                                                                
 The infrared and polarization channel makes use of an interferential circular filter,                                            
which sweeps the spectrum as it rotates. Two sectors of this wheel are occupied by                                                
narrow-band filters, which are transparent for the wavelengths 560 and 920 Nm; each                                               
of these two filters is itself divided into three zones covered with various polaroids.                                           
The filter wheel is associated with a modulator, which rotates at a faster rate, allowing                                         
the detected signal to be differentiated more easily from the superimposed noise. A                                               
fraction of the light entering the infrared polarisation channel is deflected by a beam

  The objectives of this experiment are: (i) to measure the flux density of dust particles                                        
in the high-mass range, (ii) to understand the mechanism of high-velocity impacts on                                              
the spacecraft surface, and (iii) to establish the performance of the meteoroid shields                                           
protecting a number of subsystems.

2.5 The dust-particle counter and mass analyzer (DUCMA)                                                                           
 This instrument measures the count rate and mass distribution of dust particles in                                               
the cometary environment.                                                                                                         
 The detector is a 28 micro m thick film of polarized polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF),                                             
covered on each face with a metallic conducting coating. A dust particle impacting the                                            
detector will displace a small volume of polarized material in the bulk of the detector,                                          
which then results in a fast depolarization signal whose amplitude is a known function                                            
of the particle mass and velocity. Electronic circuits measure the pulse height and ac-                                           
cumulate pulse events above four different threshold levels. Since the relative impact                                            
velocity is known (i.e. the comet-spacecraft velocity), the mass is determined direct-                                            
ly from the known mass/velocity relationship for these detectors.                                                                 
 The detector assembly is shown in Figure 5. It consists of the dust detector (M),                                                
and a small anti-coincidence detector (V), mounted perpendicular to the direction of                                              
arrival of the dust particles. The purpose of the small detector is to detect very large                                          
mechanical shocks on the spacecraft which might trigger the most sensitive level of                                               
the dust detector.                                                                                                                
 Further technical details are given in Table 6.                                                                                  
 The detector also includes an anticoincidence system mounted in a direction perpen-                                              
dicular to the direction of arrival of the dust particles.                                                                        
 This instrument was selected one year before launch and could still be considered                                                
at this late stage because it did not require any direct telemetry or telecommand inter-                                          
face with the spacecraft. Its inclusion was facilitated because it was allowed to share                                           
the data format and telecommands initially allocated to the ING instrument.

2.6 The dust-particle impact detector (SP-2)                                                                                      
 The objective of this instrument is to measure the flux and the mass distribution of                                             
the dust particles. The counter makes use of acoustical and plasma detectors (Fig. 6).                                            
The acoustical detector consists of three piezo-electric elements mounted on a mem-                                               
brane (3), two of these sensors (4) are connected to two identical recording circuits                                             
in order to improve the overall reliability of the system; the third element (5) is used                                          
as a stimuli source for calibration purposes. The membrane is mounted in a frame (l)                                              
which damps the mechanical oscillations and improves the counting rate. The detector                                              
assembly is fixed to the electronics box (6) by means of three acoustical insulators (2).                                         
Each piezo-electric element delivers a signal which is fed into a narrow-band amplifier                                           
working at a frequency of about 160 kHz. The output signal is split into l6 channels,                                             
which have their sensitivity thresholds logarithmically distributed across the whole                                              
dynamic range.                                                                                                                    
  Four identical impact plasma detectors are mounted at the periphery of the                                                      
acoustical detector. They are associated in pairs and connected to identical electronic                                           
circuits. The entrance to each detector is protected against the environmental plasma                                             
by a system of deflecting electrodes and grids (7,8). The ions and electrons generated                                            
by each particle impact are separated and collected by a grid (9) and a target (10), bet-                                         
ween which a potential difference of 2 kV is applied. The electron pulse detected by                                              
the lower electrode constitutes the input signal, which is analyzed in several channels                                           
with different sensitivity thresholds.                                                                                            
  The characteristic features of SP-2 are listed in Table 7.

2.7 The dust-particle impact plasma detector (SP-1)                                                                               
   The main scientific objective of the SP-1 instrument is similar to that of SP-2, name-                                         
ly to measure the flux and mass distribution of the dust particles.                                                               
  This instrument detects the electric charges contained in the plasma cloud generated                                            
by a solid particle impacting on a gold target. The principle of this technique is similar                                        
to that adopted for the impact plasma detectors of SP-2. The magnitude of the positive

A= 10**3C/s for an impact velocity of 78 km/s.                                                                                    
   The SP-1 system includes two similar detectors (Fig. 7). Each unit is made up of                                               
a base plate (1) covered by a gold target (2) at zero potential, perpendicular to the dust                                        
flow, and an array of strip collectors (4). The collectors are parallel to the dust flow;                                         
they are mounted on an insulator (3) and their edge is protected from impacts by a                                                
shield (5) connected electrically to the structure. Adjacent collectors are biased at                                             
potentials of 30 V, with opposite polarities. The two sets of electrodes in each detector                                         
detect a positive and a negative current pulse, which are analyzed and recorded by the                                            
electronics unit. The entrance to one detector is covered by a plastic foil, to obtain                                            
additional information on density and/or calibration factor. The characteristic                                                   
parameters of SP-1 are given in Table 8.

2.8 The dust mass spectrometer (PUMA)                                                                                             
  The dust mass spectrometer measures the chemical composition, the size and the                                                  
spatial density of solid particles using a time-of-flight technique, with particular em-                                          
phasis on the determination of the Li, C and B isotopic ratios. The operating principle                                           
of PUMA, illustrated in Figure 8a, is similar to that of the PIA instrument flown on                                              
Giotto.                                                                                                                           
  The dust particles enter through a baffle and impact on a silver target (M) at a speed                                          
of 78 km/s. The particles and a certain amount of the target material are vaporized                                               
and partly ionized. The two Vega spacecraft have different targets (Fig. 8b); one type                                            
is mounted in a cartridge as in the PIA, the second has a corrugated surface such that                                            
a larger amount of projectile ions enter the analyzer. The target is at + 1020 V; the                                             
ions are accelerated by a grid (1), which is held at a potential of -2000 V, and enter                                            
the field-free drift tube at zero potential (4). These charged particles are sent by the                                          
electrostatic reflector (5) into the second drift tube (6) and on towards the detector (7).                                       
  The ions trajectories are focused by the lenses (9), (10) and (11). A set of three elec-                                        
trodes (12), consisting of an inner grid at +1000 V between two grids at zero poten-                                              
tial, prevents ions with energies less than 1 keV from reaching the detector.                                                     
  The geometry of the reflector is designed in such a way as to bunch ions of the same                                            
species (particles with energies E>E(0) travel a larger distance than those with                                                  
energies E<E(0)) and to eliminate those with energies that deviate too much from E(0).                                            
The purpose of this mirror system is to reduce the dispersion of the flight times for                                             
particles having the same charge-to-mass ratios. The reflector potential is switched                                              
between 1000 V and 1100 V every 30 s, in order to compensate for the higher                                                       
energies of ions created by the impacts of larger particles.                                                                      
  The time-of-flight is measured with reference to three signals: the light flash record-                                         
ed by the photomultiplier (3), the pulses detected by the target (M), and the ac-                                                 
celerating grid (1). The signals induced in these sensors, in the first lens (9), in the                                          
ejecta trap (8) and in the detector (7), which are illustrated qualitatively in Figure 8c,                                        
are used to characterize the mass of the particles.

2.9 The neutral-gas mass spectrometer (ING)                                                                                       
   The neutral-gas mass spectrometer measures: (i) the distribution of the main consti-                                           
tuents of the cometary atmosphere (H2O, CO and CO2) and their dissociation pro-                                                   
ducts (O, OH, C); (ii) the distribution of the secondary constituents, such as CH4,                                               
NH3, HCN and C2H2, and their associated daughter molecules, and (iii) the isotopic                                                
ratios 13C/12C and D/H.                                                                                                           
   The instrument is mounted on a platform which can be rotated 120deg in the ecliptic                                            
plane and which includes two detection units. The main unit uses a field ionization                                               
source (FIS), which consists of 40 needles with a tip curvature radius of less than                                               
1 micro m, held at a positive potential of 50 kV (Fig. 9a). The molecules that flow in the                                        
vicinity of the tips lose one electron by field emission; the probability of multiple                                             
ionization is negligible. All ions leave the needles with approximately the same                                                  
energy, are accelerated, and pass through a carbon foil, which has a density of less                                              
than 1 micro g/cm**2. The electrons released from the foil are deflected towards a                                                
microchannel plate and initiate a pulse which indicates the start of the time taken by                                            
each successive ion to travel a distance s=10 cm, at the end of which a second pulse                                              
is generated by another microchannel plate.  The mass of the ion m is                                                             
given by 2(E-delta E)tau**2/s**2, where tau is the time of flight, E is the energy after accelera-                                
ion and delta E is the energy lost in the first impact; delta E increases with m and the resolu-                                  
tion is consequently reduced for large masses.                                                                                    
   This technique presents the remarkable advantage that the molecules are ionized                                                
without impact and are not disintegrated, but its main drawback is that it cannot dif-                                            
ferentiate the cometary neutrals from the gas evaporated from the spacecraft itself.                                              
   This deficiency is palliated by the adjunction of a second detection device (Fig. 9b)                                          
in which the molecules are ionized with an Electron Impact Source (EIS). The ions                                                 
are then deflected from their original direction by an electric field; it is therefore possi-                                     
ble to limit the access of the detector to ions with a velocity of about 78 km/s and to                                           
deflect slow particles with a retarding grid. The fast ions reach an electrostatic                                                
analyzer with a field configuration which deflects these particles towards a Micro-                                               
Channel Plate (MCP). The position of the impact, which yields the mass, is measured                                               
with a resistive anode mounted on the back of the MCP.                                                                            
   It is possible to differentiate the cometary atmosphere from the spacecraft environ-

2.10 The plasma energy analyzer (PM-1)                                                                                            
   The plasma energy analyzer monitors the change in the solar-wind parameters as the                                             
spacecraft approaches the comet, searches for the bow shock and the contact surface,                                              
and measures the density and chemical composition of the ion population.                                                          
   The instrument includes six detectors: two ion analyzers, one electron analyzer, two                                           
collectors which measure the integral plasma ion flux, and one sensor which monitors

bardment.                                                                                                                         
   The ion detectors (Fig. 10a) are designed for the study of the energy distribution                                             
of the solar and cometary particles, and not for the investigation of their three-                                                
dimensional velocity distribution. Each sensor consists of a quadripolar electrical lens                                          
(2), a hemispherical plate analyzer (3) and a channeltron (4). The energy spectrum is                                             
swept once per second by stepping the bias voltage U(A) applied between the plates.                                               
The detector oriented towards the Sun has a conical of view (1) with a half angle                                                 
of 15deg, wide enough to detect the solar wind both upstream and downstream of the                                                
cometary bow shock.                                                                                                               
   The ion detector oriented along the spacecraft-comet velocity vector is intended for                                           
operation in the innermost part of the coma, where the cometary ions are expected to                                              
have thermal velocities that are negligible with respect to their relative drift velocity                                         
of 78 km/s. This system can therefore be used as a mass spectrometer in the range                                                 
1-110 amu with a resolution m/delta m = 20; the minimum measurable ion density is                                                 
10**-3/cm**3.                                                                                                                     
   The electron analyzer (Fig. 1Ob) has an aperture of 0.03 cm**2, an angular resolu-                                             
tion of +/-2.5deg, and an energy resolution of +/-5%; its geometrical factor is 10**-5 E                                          
(keV) (cm**2.sr.keV). Its aperture is oriented perpendicular to the Sun and relative-                                             
velocity directions in order to eliminate interferences generated by photon and particle                                          
impacts. The energy spectrum is scanned by applying a series of logarithmically                                                   
distributed voltage steps U(A) to a cylindrical deflection unit (1). The entrance of the                                          
instrument is controlled by a collimator (2) and a grid (3); the detector is a channeltron                                        
(4).                                                                                                                              
   The integral detector which measures the solar-wind ions (Fig. 10c) consists of a                                              
collimator, a number of grids to limit the flux of photoelectrons, and a collector. A                                             
potential of +3500 V is periodically applied to one of the grids in order to stop the                                             
ion flux and evaluate the interference background. The aperture has an area of 5 cm**2                                            
and the dynamic range of the measurements extends from +/- 10**-11 A to +/- 3x10**-9 A.                                           
   The integral detector, which is aligned with the relative-velocity vector (Fig. 10d),                                          
has similar features, but the electrodes are configured such that the incoming dust par-                                          
ticles and neutral molecules can only impact on the first diaphragm and on the collec-                                            
tor. By biasing the electrodes differently, in an alternative configuration, it is possible                                       
to discriminate between the cometary ions and the charged particles produced by                                                   
various impact ionization processes.                                                                                              
   The impact plasma monitor (Fig. 10e) is a gold electrode, biased at a fixed potential                                          
of -17 V, which measures the integral flux of electrons emitted by the impact of                                                  
neutral gas, dust particles and photons, in the range 10**-10-3x10**-5 A.                                                         
   The characteristics of the various detectors are summarized in Table 11.

2.11 The energetic-particle analyzer (TN-M)                                                                                       
  The prime objective of the energetic-particle analyzer is to measure the energy and                                             
flux of the cometary ions that might be accelerated by, for example, solar-wind                                                   
magnetic fields.                                                                                                                  
  Two similar telescopes provide information about the angular distribution of the ion                                            
flux; one is oriented at right angles to the magnetic field, in the ecliptic plane; the other                                     
detector looks in the same plane, in a direction at 35deg to the first telescope and approx-                                      
imately opposite to the spacecraft velocity vector.                                                                               
  Each telescope consists of two silicium detectors, A (8 mm in diameter and 0.1 mm                                               
thick) and B (16 mm in diameter and 1 mm thick), and an anti-coincidence scintilla-                                               
tion shield (Fig. 11). Electrons with energies of less than 0.2 MeV are deflected away                                            
from the entrance aperture by a magnet. The low-energy (30-640 keV) ions trigger                                                  
a signal in detector A only. More energetic particles are detected in both A and B,                                               
and it is possible to distinguish between electrons, protons and heavier nuclei by com-                                           
paring the amplitudes of the signals delivered by the two detectors.                                                              
  The characteristic parameters of these two telescopes are given in Table 12.

2.12 The magnetometer (MISCHA)                                                                                                    
 The prime objective of the magnetometer experiment is to determine the role of the                                               
magnetic field in the interaction between the solar wind and the comet and to identify                                            
the characteristic boundaries of the cometary environment (bow shock, contact sur-                                                
face, etc.).                                                                                                                      
  The sensors of the MISCHA magnetometer (Fig. 12,) are mounted on a boom,                                                        
which can be seen on the lower edge of the right-hand solar panel in Figure 15. A                                                 
single-axis sensor and a triaxial sensor are mounted 1 and 2 m, respectively, from the                                            
edge of the solar panel. The advantage of this dual-sensor fluxgate system is the                                                 
possibility to determine the spacecraft's stray magnetic field. The basic features of this                                        
instrument are summarized in Table 13.

   The main objectives of the APV-N experiment are: (i) to investigate collective                                                 
plasma processes and fine structures in the zone of interaction between the comet and                                             
the solar wind, (ii) to detect the anomalous ionization of the cometary atmosphere by                                             
the solar wind and identify the mechanism of this phenomenon, and (iii) to measure                                                
the spectra of the electromagnetic and electrostatic instabilities in the solar wind and                                          
cometary ionosphere and to search for the bow shock and contact surface.

   The experiment consists of two sensors, one dipole made of two meshed spheres                                                  
with integral pre-amplifiers and a Faraday cup, and an electronics box (Fig. 13). The                                             
dipole detects electric fields and the Faraday cup measures ion-flux fluctuations with                                            
frequencies of up to 1 kHz. The electric sensors are mounted on a Y-shaped 5 m long                                               
boom and the Faraday cup is located on the spacecraft body (Fig. 14).                                                             
   The main parameters of the APV-N experiment are given in Table 14.                                                             
                                                                                                                                  
2.14  The electric-field and Langmuir-probes experiment (APV-V)                                                                   
   The primary objectives of the plasma and wave measurements performed by APV-V                                                  
are: (i) to measure the density of the solar wind just before it is influenced by cometary                                        
constituents, thereby establishing a reference for understanding the subsequent solar.                                            
wind-comet interaction, (ii) to observe the mass loading of the solar wind by com-                                                
etary ions, either directly or through the associated wave instabilities, (iii) to obtain                                         
plasma-density and temperature profiles, as well as wave-frequency spectra during the                                             
cometary transit, and (iv) to search for the signatures of collision-free shocks and con-                                         
tact surface.                                                                                                                     
   The sensors are mounted on two symmetrical stubs attached to the outer solar panels                                            
(Fig. 15). Two spheres, 10 cm in diameter (Fig. 14a) and separated by 11 m, form                                                  
a dipole for measuring electric fields. The Langmuir probes are fixed at mid length;                                              
they are cylindrical and their collecting area is 4.4 cm**2; they are oriented in such a                                          
way that their symmetry axis is parallel to the gas-flow velocity vector during the                                               
flyby; conical elements fixed at their tips protect them from the direct impact of corn-                                          
etary gas and dust particles (Fig. 14b).

module; the whole system weighed about 4.5 t. The Halley probe is shown in                                                        
Figure 15 in its nominal flyby configuration: the orientation of the vehicle velocity                                             
relative to the comet is also indicated. The spacecraft has a wingspan of the order of                                            
10 m, and it carries 120 kg of scientific instrumentation. On its trajectory to Venus,                                            
the probe was still surmounted by the descent module (not shown in Fig. 15), which                                                
was a spherical object with a diameter of 2.5 m and a mass of approximately 2 t.                                                  
The Vega vehicle is derived from the Venera series of spacecraft. A number of                                                     
modifications improve the reliability of the probe; for example, 5 m**2 of shield have                                            
been added in order to protect the most essential subsystems against the bombardment                                              
of dust particles with masses of less than 0.1 g. A dual-sheet bumper shield has                                                  
been adopted; it is composed of a thin metallic front sheet (0.4 mm) and a thicker rear                                           
sheet, separated by several centimetres.

  The spacecraft structure resembles a cylindrical body connected to two conical                                                  
skirts. The lower skirt houses a motor for orbital manoeuvres and a toroidal pressurized                                          
utility instrument bay; the cylindrical compartment contains the fuel tanks and the                                               
upper skirt is the interface that held the Venus lander. Two pairs of deployable solar                                            
panels are mounted on each side of the cylindrical section: the solar array has a total                                           
area of nearly 10 m**2. The spacecraft is three-axis-stabilized during the cometary                                               
flyby by a gyroscopic system and a number of gas nozzles, most of which are mounted                                               
on the solar panels.                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                  
  The telemetry system consists of a high-data-rate channel (BRL) and a low-data-rate                                             
channel (BTM). The BRL channel is used for real-time transmission only. Its capacity                                              
of 65536 bit/s can be reduced by half if required by propagation conditions; that of                                              
the BTM channel is 3072 bit/s. The scientific data can also be stored by onboard                                                  
magnetic tape recorders (capacity 5 Mbit) and subsequently telemetered through the                                                
BTM channel, once every 20 days during the interplanetary transit and once every                                                  
20 min around the time of cometary flyby. The high-gain antenna must be directed                                                  
towards the Earth whenever data are transmitted via the BRL channel.                                                              
  The scientific instruments can be classified into three categories, characterized by                                            
common objectives:                                                                                                                
(i)  The electromagnetic field sensors (MISCHA, APV-N and APV-V) are mounted                                                      
      on booms, as far as possible from the spacecraft to achieve the best degree of                                              
      electromagnetic cleanliness.                                                                                                
(ii) The dust, gas and plasma detectors have pointing directions generally related to                                             
     the spacecraft velocity relative to the comet.                                                                               
(iii)  The optical systems that observe the nucleus (TVS, IKS, TKS) are located on                                                
    the automatic pointing platform.                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                  
The platform is shown in Figure 16; it has a mass of 82 kg and carries 64 kg of in-                                               
strumentation. It can scan an angular sector of 110deg in the ecliptic plane, and 60deg in                                        
a plane perpendicular to the ecliptic.

platform without thermal blanket                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                  
4. The Mission                                                                                                                    
  The Vega spacecraft were launched from the Tyuratam pad area of the Baykonour                                                   
Cosmodrome by two three-stage Proton rockets fitted with six strap-on boosters. The                                               
space vehicles were injected into their trajectories towards Venus before completing                                              
their first revolution around the Earth (Fig. 17a).                                                                               
   During most of the transit towards Venus, the solar panels were oriented towards                                               
the Sun. The spacecraft's attitudes were not otherwise controlled, except during possi-                                           
ble periods of a few hours when three-axis-stabilization was required for high-bit-rate                                           
data transmission. Orbital corrections were performed during the first two weeks after                                            
launch and was repeated during the last two weeks before arrival in the environment                                               
of Venus.                                                                                                                         
   Three further orbital manoeuvres were foreseen on the second leg of the journey                                                
to Comet Halley: the first, two to four weeks (Fig. 17b) after the Venus flyby, the                                               
second midway between the planet and the comet, and the last two to four weeks                                                    
before the Halley flyby. Once the last manoeuvre has been performed, the pointing                                                 
platform will be oriented and the camera can then take its first look at the comet.

an angle of 18deg. The nodes are the points                                                                                       
where Halley's orbit intersects the ecliptic                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                  
  All experiments are to be switched on two days before closest approach. The direct                                              
high-speed telemetry will be transmitted from -48 h to -45 h at a cometary distance                                               
of 14x10**6 km, from -24 h to -22 h at a cometary distance of 7 x 10**6 km and from                                               
-2 h to + 1 h during the cometary flyby.   Two other high-speed telemetry                                                         
transmission sequences are also foreseen, one and two days after flyby. A limited                                                 
amount of data can also be stored and transferred every 20 min to the onboard tape                                                
recorder, in order to cover the 22 h gaps when the high-speed telemetry is switched                                               
off (Table 1).
