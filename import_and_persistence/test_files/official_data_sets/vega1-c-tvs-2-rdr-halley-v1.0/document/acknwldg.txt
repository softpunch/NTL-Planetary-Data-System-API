                          ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS                                    
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
     These Acknowledgements are concerned with the final steps of CD-ROM      
preparation and production, steps which were largely taken by a handful of    
individuals at the NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center, working in collaboration 
with the Small Bodies Node (SBN) of the Planetary Data System.                
                                                                              
     The simple truth is that if the goal is to create a useful archive, one  
that is replete with searchable indices, tables of interest, software, and    
lucid documentation, and, moreover, one which possesses a useful and efficient
directory layout (or "CDTREE"), then a very large amount of effort is         
required.  It probably comes as no surprise to the reader that many revisions 
of plan are encountered along the way, as a scheme which once seemed promising
now looks like the course NOT to follow.                                      
                                                                              
     Once the entire IHW dataset had been transferred and was on-line at      
the Small Bodies Node (SBN) of the Planetary Data System (PDS) it was         
possible to complete the set with the help of Dan Klinglesmith and Mal        
Niedner in the Laboratory for Astronomy and Solar Physics.                    
                                                                              
     This brings the story nearly up-to-date (i.e., December 1993).  In the   
last 24 months a great deal of work has been expended at NASA/GSFC (in        
collaboration with the SBN) to perform the following tasks:                   
   o reviewing and revising the layout of the space disks;                    
   o responding to calls by the Discipline Specialists for error correction of
      headers and data (hundreds of files across several of the disciplines), 
      made possible by the headers/data being "on-line";                      
   o creating searchable, delimited tables and indices from on-line headers   
      and data;                                                               
   o generating PDS labels for all datafiles;                                 
   o writing/editing of documentation to allow the archive user to understand 
      the disc contents and layout; and                                       
   o frequent checking of procedures and products.                            
   o responding to the SBN Peer Review of the Remote Data CD-ROMs by          
      incorporating some simplifying design changes                           
                                                                              
     The above should be considered a partial list of the activities which    
occurred after the IHW data were deposited on the NSSDC Publisher in the      
late-summer of 1992.  If it is appropriate to single out a particular         
individual within the last 8-12 months, then that person surely is Dan        
Klinglesmith, who has been extremely active in planning the work.  This       
also includes efforts from Mal Niedner to work through the GSFC contract      
to get the final volumes produced                                             
                                                                              
     Data preparation for the last series of IHW CD-ROMs (25 and 26), that of 
the "Spacecraft Data", is now complete at the SBN, University of Maryland,    
under the direction of Ed Grayzeck and Mike A'Hearn.   We would like to       
acknowledge individual efforts in this preparation:
