      photometry of Comet 1P/Halley as part of the International              
      Halley Watch (IHW) Photometry and Polarimetry Netword (PPN).            
      Standard filters, reference stars and reduction procedures              
      were used as far as possible to reduce all narrowband data              
      submitted to the PPN.  The original data have been reformatted

      The data are in tabular form, and are presented as a single             
      summary table sorted chronologically.  Information identifying          
      the original source file from version 1 of this data set has

      A standard narrow-band filter set, already in development               
      prior to the IHW, was formalized and extended during the                
      Halley Watch project.  The general filter parameters were               
      summarized in tables in Sekanina (1991)  ('JPL D-400-450'               
      in the reference list), and have been included in the                   
      documentation files of this data set.                                   
                                                                              
      An initial set of five filters was manufactured and                     
      distributed at the beginning of the IHW period:

      A second set of filters was added as they were produced                 
      after the start of the Halley Watch:

      In addition, three observatories (Lowell, Cerro Tololo and Perth)       
      also made use of an existing NH filter centered at 3365 A.

      A set of standard stars specifically selected for narrowband            
      photometry of comets was defined and distributed to PPN                 
      observers.  An organized campaign to observe suitable                   
      standards using the IHW filter set took place in two                    
      parts: first, Zellner and Wisniewski (1985) observed                    
      standards using the initial set of five filters; second,                
      the PPN disipline specialists themselves as well as a number            
      of colleagues undertook a campaign to establish standard                
      star magnitudes for the filters not included in the work                
      of Wisniewski and Zellner (1985).  A summary of this                    
      second observing program is in Osborne et al. (1990).                   
                                                                              
      Data Reduction                                                          
      ==============                                                          
      In order to minimize variations due to differences in local             
      reduction procedures (in calculating airmass, for example),             
      the PPN requested observers submit instrumental magnitudes              
      outside the atmosphere, and completed the reduction to                  
      magnitude and flux using a single standard technique,                   
      described in detail in Sekanina (1991) ('JPL D-400-450' in              
      the reference list).  Where possible, data that were received           
      in a more advances state of reduction were back-processed to            
      the instrumental magnitude stage and rereduced using the                
      standard procedures.  Thus, values for fluxes, errors and               
      airmasses may vary substantially in this data set from those            
      present in the original file submissions of version 1.                  
                                                                              
      Modification History                                                    
      ====================                                                    
      The first version of this data set contained 2500 sets of               
      individual observation files.  Each individual observation              
      was a table of results from a specific observer using a                 
      particular system (observatory + telescope + detector)                  
      on a single night.  For each such file, there was a PDS label           
      file, a FITS table header file detached from the data, and              
      the FITS table data segment.                                            
                                                                              
      After the first version was archived, personnel at the PDS              
      Small Bodies Node (SBN) re-reduced a large part of the data             
      using the standard technique described in 'Photometry and               
      Polarimetry' chapter of 'The Comet Halley Archive Summary               
      Volume' (cited in the reference list as 'JPL 400-450').  An             
      abbreviated list of notes about specific reprocessing was               
      created as an HTML errata file displayed on the SBN archive             
      pages.  A summary table of all results was also created and             
      offered as an 'index table'.                                            
                                                                              
      To create version 2, SBN personnel did the following:                   
                                                                              
        o  Observer, telescope and observatory information was                
           recovered from the FITS headers and inserted into the              
           'index table'.                                                     
                                                                              
        o  Observing times in the 'index table', originally                   
           stated as day number and fraction, were converted to the           
           ISO standard time format (yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss).  Day               
           fractions were always supplied with at least four                  
           significant digits (five in some unusual cases).  Note             
           that, therefore, times are never more accurate than the            
           nearest second, and typically are only accurate to                 
           +/- 5 seconds.                                                     
                                                                              
        o  A check of 'index table' lines vs total observations in the        
           original FITS tables revealed a discrepancy of 25 lines            
           submitted but not included in the 'index table'.                   
           These were accounted for thus:                                     
                                                                              
                - Three files, each with eight record - pflx2285,             
                  pflx2370 and pflx2388, contained no aperture size

      Because these observations were rereduced by the IHW Photometry         
      and Polarimetry Network (PPN) personnel, errors have been               
      calculated for each flux in a uniform way wherever sufficient           
      information was available.  See Sekanina et al. (1991)                  
      ('JPL D-400-450' in the reference list') for details of the             
      reduction process and error propagation.                                
                                                                              
      Note that, because times were reported as day fractions with            
      only four (or sometimes five) significant digits, all time              
      values listed anywhere in this data set - data files, labels,           
      or elsewhere - are never accurate to more than one second, and          
      are typically accurate to only +/- about five seconds.                  
                                                                              
      Also, the following comment was included among the errata for           
      these data:                                                             
                                                                              
         For a number of NARROW BAND measurements, the integration            
         times are not given; in these instances the original                 
         submissions only reported 'average' values.
