      The Photometry and Polarimetry Network (PPN) of the International       
      Halley Watch (IHW) collected photometric and polarimetric data          
      from observers around the world.  It established uniform filters,       
      standard stars and reduction methods for comet photometry.  Four        
      types of results are included in the PPN archives:
