  This table contains the text of the notes referenced by number in           
  the main data table.  These notes concern the reprocessing performed        
  by personnel at the PDS Small Bodies Node after the original data           
  were archived.  These notes were compiled and displayed as an HTML          
  file on the SBN website in January 1996.                                    
                                                                              
  Unfortunately, there are a number of acronyms and references that can       
  no longer be resolved.  Following is a list of terms you will encounter     
  in the notes.  Unless otherwise noted, all software referenced was          
  developed at the SBN using the reduction method detailed in the IHW         
  documentation.                                                              
                                                                              
     idxunix.52extra  Apparently a file containing additional data.  This     
                file could not be located.

     INTERP1**  'INTERP1' was the name of a FORTRAN program running on        
                a PC used to perform part of the flux calculation (the        
                asterisks appear to be an attempt to reference a

     m0x        Apparently a reference to a file type (i.e., extension),      
                possibly one produced as an output file by, for example,      
                the PHOTOM program.  No matching files could be located,      
                however.                                                      
                                                                              
     PHOTOM*    'PHOTOM' was the name of a FORTRAN program running on         
                a PC used to perform part of the photometric reduction        
                process (the asterisk appears to be an attempt to
