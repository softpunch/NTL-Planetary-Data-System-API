 3 Calculated k separately for HD89688 and HD105590 (omitted west entry) 
   to get weighted mean k and error(k), used these k's to predict dM for 
   each star entry, then used mean and sdev to get dM and error(dM)

   calc dM for each star, mean and sdev to get dM and error (dM)

 9 Comet is only west in the sky, all stars are west, used simultaneous  
   fit from PHOTOM*                                                      
                                                                         
10 Comet was west and all 3 star entries were west.  Used simultaneous   
   PHOTOM* fits                                                          
                                                                         
11 Comet was west and all star entries were west. Everything looks okay  
   (compared with TUN26BZ, 6/26/86, and TUN30BZ, 6/30/86) except HD89688 
   filters 7 and 8, so omitted them from the PHOTOM* fit.  Assumed       
   delta_k=0.01, delta_0.05 for filters 7 and 8                          
                                                                         
12 Fits are nice so just used k's and dM's from combined fit to HD3379   
   and HD219188 using PHOTOM* X's                                        
                                                                         
13 Fits are nice so just used k's and dM's from combined fit to HD3379   
   and HD25680 using PHOTOM* X's                                         
                                                                         
14 No stars available to calculate k's separately, fits are nice so just 
   used k's and dM's from combined fit to HD34078 (original X's) and     
   HD3379 and HD219188 (PHOTOM* X's)                                     
                                                                         
15 No way to calculate k from individual star, so averaged dM's from     
   51113 (11/13/85) and 51115 (11/15/85) to get dM, error(dM), then      
   predicted k's from those dM's, k's are simialer to those found on     
   51113 and 51115, used 0.01 for error(k)                               
                                                                         
16 Omitted HD52266 and fit all 4 entries for HD25680 together to get     
   k's and dM's, not much airmass covered, but k's are more reasonable   
   than if HD52266 were included                                         
                                                                         
17 Supplemented m0 data with other stars (see "imx" file).  Used         
   PHOTOM* to calculate k's and dM's for east and west separately.       
   dM seems to be different for east and west sides of the meridian.     
   -Missing continuous mag 6840 and 5140- (PHOTOM* omitted data from     
   this set).                                                            
                                                                         
18 The 3 star entries were 3 different stars, but PHOTOM* fit seemed to  
   be okay, so used it                                                   
                                                                         
19 There are extra Tarija fluxes from this night, 1986May01. They are    
   located in the idxunix.52extra file and have made up catalog numbers.
