This volume contains Version 2 of the International Halley Watch (IHW)        
Photometry and Polarimetry Network (PPN) photometric flux data.  These        
data were largely reprocessed by personnel of the PDS Small Bodies            
Node after original submission and archiving.  The reprocessing applied       
uniform reduction techniques and standards to the submitted data, to          
yield a more consistent set of results.
