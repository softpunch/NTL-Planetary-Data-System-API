Note that the data set description retrieved from the PDS catalog             
contained no useful descriptive information, and the links to other           
catalog objects were incorrect.  The revised version references               
"Various Ground-based Telescopes" as the INSTRUMENT_HOST and                  
"Various Ground-based Detectors" as the INSTRUMENT - both of which            
are placeholders used when multiple telescopes and instruments                
contribute data to a single data set.  For details about the                  
instruments used that are not included in the data tables, please             
see the reference cited in the REFERENCE.CAT file.
