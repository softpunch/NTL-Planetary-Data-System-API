Re-organized International Halley Watch (IHW) Data Sets                       
=======================================================                       
The original IHW volume HAL_1001 contained three data sets (in addition       
to others) that were considered addenda to data sets in the original          
HAL_0001-HAL_0026 volume set, but were assigned new DATA_SET_IDs for          
one reason or another.  As part of an effort to reorganize physical           
volume-based into the contemporary, single-data-set-per-volume format,        
these data sets have reorganized into the present format. Supporting          
documents from HAL_1001 that were relevant to these data have been            
included in each data set.
