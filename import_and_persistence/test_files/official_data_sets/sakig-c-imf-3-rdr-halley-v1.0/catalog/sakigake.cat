    ================                                                          
                                                                              
      Planet-A and MS-T5 were launched separately by                          
      M-3SII launchers.  The M-3SII launcher is a new                         
      three-stage solid-propellant rocket with - a solid                      
      kick-stage motor attached.  Both spacecraft were                        
      injected directly into a heliocentric comet                             
      transfer trajectory.  Immediately after launch,                         
      each spacecraft was tracked for about 8 h per day.                      
      They were be despun from 120 rpm, to about 30 rpm,                      
      using the thruster subsystem.  The spacecraft's                         
      attitude was initially automatically adjusted such                      
      that its spin axis was perpendicular to the                             
      Sun-spacecraft line.  During the subsequent ground                      
      contact, the spin rate was further reduced to 6.3                       
      rpm and the spin axis reoriented to be                                  
      perpendicular to the ecliptic plane.  After the                         
      first 4-5 d of ranging and accurate orbit                               
      determination, a mid-course correction manoeuvre                        
      was carried out.  During the interplanetary cruise,                     
      attitude maintenance operations will have to be                         
      performed at 1Od intervals.                                             
                                                                              
      Both spacecraft will make their closest approach to                     
      Halley near the time of the comet's post-perihelion                     
      crossing of the ecliptic plane.  MS-T5 has as its                       
      scientific objective: - to study the solar-wind                         
      plasma and, if possible, determine the signatures

    ===========================                                               
                                                                              
      Japan's Institute of Space and Astronautical                            
      Science (ISAS) first decided in 1979 to send a                          
      spacecraft to Comet Halley.  This decision was                          
      supported both by Japanese scientists who were                          
      anxious to carry out an interplanetary mission and                      
      by those Institute engineers who wanted to                              
      demonstrate the capabilities of a new launch                            
      vehicle.  Comet Halley was considered a                                 
      scientifically meaningful target because it has                         
      never been explored previously from close-range, it                     
      displays a wide range of interesting phenomena, and                     
      it returns only once every 76 years.                                    
                                                                              
      The Japanese mission to Comet Halley, called the                        
      `Planet-A' mission, involved the launch of the                          
      `Suisei', or Planet-A, spacecraft on 19 August                          
      1985, to encounter Comet Halley in March 1986.  In                      
      keeping with our normal procedure of launching a                        
      test spacecraft to confirm the flight performance                       
      of a newly developed launch system and the                              
      necessary technology for the main mission, a test                       
      spacecraft called `Sakigake' (i.e.  Pioneer), or                        
      MS-T5, was launched on 8 January 1985.  Hence, the                      
      Planet-A project actually involves two spacecraft,                      
      Planet-A and MS-T5.                                                     
                                                                              
      Initial calculations based on launcher performance                      
      and mission requirements led to a mass of about 140                     
      kg for each spacecraft, allowing a scientific                           
      payload consisting of two or three experiments,                         
      each typically weighing 5 kg.  An EUV imaging                           
      experiment and a solar-wind plasma experiment were                      
      selected from many proposed experiments for                             
      Planet-A, while MS-T5 carries three experiments for                     
      measurements of plasma waves, solar-wind plasma and                     
      the interplanetary magnetic field.  The MS-T5                           
      spacecraft will be targeted to pass within 7                            
      million kilmeters of Comet Halley on 11 March 1986.                     
      About one month of this test spacecraft's initial                       
      cruise phase will be used for technical tests,                          
      including the operation of the new 64 m deep-space                      
      station at Usuda.  Later, its three scientific                          
      instruments will study the solar-wind plasma and,                       
      if possible, detect the signatures of the                               
      solar-wind/comet interaction.  When the other                           
      spacecraft make their closest approach to Halley,                       
      MS-T5 will be used to make complementary solar-wind                     
      measurements."
