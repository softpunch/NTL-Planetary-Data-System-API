 DESCRIPTION        = "The original Data Set Name was MST5IMF.   The          
 4 sec data was submitted by Dr. Oyama.  The data start/stop time             
 are 19:40:17 on March 10, 1986 and 02:41:43 on March 13, 1986.   The         
 magnetic field is defined in terms of solar ecliptic coordinates with        
 spacecraft at the center and the x direction positive towards the Sun,       
 the y direction in the ecliptic plane, and the z direction given by          
 a right handed coordinate system.   The angles appear to be negatively       
 defined as compared to the published results by Saito et al. (1986)."
