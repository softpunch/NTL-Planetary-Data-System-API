   The Giotto Particulate Impact Analyser (PIA) will provide information on the com-                                              
position of individual dust particles and the average composition and mass distribution                                           
of cometary matter released by Comet Halley.  Knowledge of the material's composi-                                                
tion and isotopic ratios (e.g. 7Li/6Li, 11B/10B, and 13C/12C) will significantly increase                                         
our understanding of the current status and the genesis of comets. The instrument is                                              
derived from the dust experiment flown onboard the Helios-1 and -2 satellites, but                                                
mass resolution has been improved to m/dm> 150 (PIA), which is sufficient to                                                      
separate adjacent mass lines over the complete mass range of 1-110 u.                                                             
   Variations in particle type or mean composition as a function of distance from the                                             
comet will yield information on the release mechanism. Impacts of particulates will                                               
be identified using the coincidence between the impact light flash and the signals from                                           
the positive ions formed during the impact process. The instrument will be sensitive                                              
to particles ranging in size from 3x 10**-16 to 5 x 10**-10 g (0.1-10 micro m diameter) with                                      
impact rates of up to 100 per second. Depending on the actual impact rate, data on                                                
some 1000-5000 cometary particles should be gathered by the Analyser.                                                             
   The instrument has already been switched on and tested in orbit, on 13 October                                                 
1985, and is performing flawlessly.                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                  
1. Introduction                                                                                                                   
   It is generally accepted that comets are so far best described by a 'dirty-snowball'                                           
model devised by Fred Whipple (1950). As such comets as Halley are thought to have                                                
remained largely unaltered since their formation in the solar system, the return of                                               
Comet P/Halley in 1986 provides a unique opportunity for in-situ studies of this                                                  
unique material.  One of the ten instruments carried by the Giotto spacecraft, launched                                           
on 2 July 1985, is the Particulate Impact Analyser (Figs. 1 and 2), which will provide                                            
information on the chemical composition of dust particles released by the comet.

2. Scientific Objectives                                                                                                          
   The basic objective of the PIA instrument is in-situ measurement of the chemical                                               
and physical properties of cometary dust particles during the Giotto spacecraft's transit                                         
through the dust envelope of Comet Halley on the night of 13/14 March 1986. The                                                   
chemical composition and masses of individual particles will be measured. Their im-                                               
pact rate, determined as a function of position relative to the comet's nucleus, will be                                          
used to establish the mass distribution and production characteristics of cometary dust.

3.  Scientific Background                                                                                                         
3.1 Composition of cometary dust                                                                                                  
 The comet's nucleus, a body a few kilometres in diameter, contains all the comet's                                               
mass. It consists of ices, which make up the volatile components, and particulates,                                               
dust and rocks, which constitute the nonvolatile component. The dust is believed to                                               
be loosely mixed with the ices, so that the nucleus may be described as a 'dirty                                                  
snowball' (Whipple, 1950). Circumstantial evidence suggests that the dust is par-                                                 
ticulate in structure, largely cemented by the ices, very fragile and of low bulk density.                                        
Cometary nuclei appear to be highly inhomogeneous in terms of both chemical com-                                                  
position and physical structure. Many comets are believed to have their ice supplies                                              
dominated by H2O, as predicted by Whipple (1950), although there is also evidence                                                 
for the prevalence of more volatile substances in some comets.                                                                    
  The composition of the dust is largely unknown. Fragmentary information has been                                                
provided by infrared observations of a 1O micro m emission feature, which is attributed to                                        
silicates (Ney, 1974), from spectroscopic evidence on some metals (especially sodium                                              
and iron) far from the nucleus in comets with small perihelion distances, from spectra                                            
of meteors which can be correlated with the producing comet (Millman, 1977), and                                                  
in a more qualitative fashion, also from high repulsive accelerations (due to the                                                 
pressure of the solar light) on particles in some comet tails, indicative of the presence                                         
of (electrically) conducting materials. This is just one major question to be clarified                                           
by the PIA investigation.                                                                                                         
  It may also be possible to find larger (>>0.2 micro m diameter) particles dominated by                                          
individual minerals. One might, for instance, discover refractory-element-rich ob-                                                
jects, which occur in some carbonaceous chondrites (notably Ca-Al-rich inclusions in                                              
allende). Their presence in the comet would indicate that such large refractory grains                                            
do indeed exist in interstellar space. Similarly, the presence of other minerals like                                             
magnetite or iron particles would suggest analogous conclusions. This would preclude                                              
extensive melting and recondensation of pre-cometary material, thus placing strong                                                
constraints on the processes leading to the formation of comets (Clayton, 1980). It is                                            
uncertain whether individual cometary particles are single crystals or aggregates of                                              
crystals. In the latter case one could imagine larger crystals surrounded by the very                                             
fine grained 'matrix' material, particles similar to those collected by Brownlee (1978).                                          
  In either case, it will be possible with the PIA instrument to identify cosmo-                                                  
chemically important minerals if they are present at all (Table 2).                                                               
                                                                                                                                  
3.2 Variations in composition                                                                                                     
  Every time a comet approaches the Sun, it loses part of its mass by evaporation of                                              
the ices, which in turn drag along the dust particles. The distribution of particles in                                           
the dust tail and the corresponding light-intensity distribution were shown by Finson                                             
& Probstein (1968) to contain astrophysically significant information on the produc-                                              
tion of dust with time, on the particle size distribution function, and on the particle                                           
ejection (terminal) velocities. However, this ingenious combined dynamical/                                                       
photometric-type method depends on certain assumptions regarding density, radius,                                                 
radiation pressure susceptibility, on mass production rate and albedo. Knowledge of                                               
the chemical composition of the dust particles will therefore significantly improve our                                           
understanding of their dynamic behaviour.                                                                                         
   An interesting consequence of the chemical heterogeneity of the nucleus is that less-                                          
volatile ices may be dragged away from its surface together with dust by the outgass-                                             
ing of more volatile ices. Delsemme & Wenger (1970) observed stripping of grains                                                  
from a body of clathrate snow in their laboratory experiment. Moreover, the con-                                                  
tinuous spectrum of Comet 1960II was interpreted by Delsemme & Miller (1971) in                                                   
terms of an ice-grain halo, the extent of which at heliocentric distances around 1 AU                                             
is small and recognizable by the steep rate of decrease of its radial brightness profile.                                         
The chemical heterogeneity of the nucleus mentioned above suggests that less-volatile                                             
ice grains may be expelled in the same way as the dust is ejected. The variation in                                               
the composition data acquired by the PIA instrument will yield a great deal of informa-                                           
tion on the ice grains, provided the spacecraft's closest approach remains close to the                                           
nominal 500 km.                                                                                                                   
   If the surface of a comet were perfectly homogeneous, the comet's activity would                                               
be symmetrical with respect to the subsolar point. The nucleus' rotation, however, and                                            
the existence of heterogeneities, produce unpredictable local variations in the produc-                                           
tion of both gas and dust, which, in turn, are responsible for the frequently observed                                            
deviations of the coma from symmetry and for the complicated coma structure, in-                                                  
cluding such features as jets, fans, halos, secondary condensations, etc. Our investiga-                                          
tion can clarify whether there are groups of particles of similar composition associated                                          
with those phenomena.                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                  
3.3  Light elements and isotopic data                                                                                             
   Individual grains may show rather different isotopic compositions for several                                                  
elements. Such differences exist in meteorites (isotopic anomalies) and again are most                                            
pronounced in allende. However, these 'anomalies', as far as we know today, are most                                              
pronounced in the noble gases (>10%), which are not accessible to the PIA instru-                                                 
ment, and in oxygen and magnesium (<10%), which will not be measurable either.                                                    
  Averaging over many grains provides some interesting bulk properties in the abun-                                               
dances of some light elements. The bulk composition in carbonaceous chondrites and                                                
the Sun are closely similar. Still, there are notable exceptions. For example, lithium                                            
(Muller et al., 1975) is less abundant in the Sun by a factor 10**-2 than in C1, C2, and                                          
C2 carbonaceous chondrites (Nichiporuk & Moore, 1974), enstatite chondrites                                                       
(Mason, 1971), pre-main sequence stars and young clusters (Zappala, 1972), as well                                                
as the stellar and interstellar media (Reeves & Meyer, 1978). Since stellar and in-                                               
terstellar abundances are about a factor of 2.2 below meteoritic ones, it will be in-                                             
teresting to study the trends in the cometary values. Similar enhancements between

carbonaceous-chondrite abundances and solar versus stellar values do exist for                                                    
beryllium (2,8) and boron (9,3). Meyer (1978) has discussed the idea that these Li,                                               
Be, B-enhancements in meteorites might be spallogene, due to energetic particle ir-                                               
radiation after formation of the Sun. If this is true, it could have affected comets only                                         
if they formed after the Sun. Even so, if comets originated far away from the                                                     
meteorites, they would be less affected anyway, unless there were a particle source                                               
other than the Sun. Such arguments carry over to light-element isotopic ratios.                                                   
  Since the 11B/10B ratio on the Earth, Moon and meteorites is about 4.05 +/- 0.1                                                 
(Mason, 1971), it cannot be explained by beta-production through high-energy cosmic-                                              
ray spallation reaction within the lifetime of the Galaxy. This would only give                                                   
11B/10B=2.5. A postulated low energy (several 10 MeV/n) component would yield the                                                 
ratio observed, but it is not obtainable by demodulation of the galactic cosmic-ray in-                                           
tensity observed near the Sun (e.g. Morfill et al., 1976). A cometary observation                                                 
would lend support to (or exclude in the case of a small ratio) the relatively large-scale                                        
nature of such a low-energy component.                                                                                            
  The 7Li/6Li ratio is observed to be about 12.5 (Krankowsky & Muller, 1976;                                                      
Balsiger et al., 1968) in various meteoritic and terrestrial rocks. A spallation source                                           
from demodulated high-energy cosmic-rays could quantitatively produce the observed                                                
6Li over the age of the Galaxy, but would only lead to 7Li/6Li=1.8. Various forms of                                              
low-energy cosmic-ray components would bring this ratio up to 6 (Reeves & Meyer,                                                  
1978). The role of extragalactic matter, containing 7Li produced in the 'Big Bang'                                                
is also discussed. Since the 7Li abundance is strongly related to Big-Bang conditions,                                            
this measurement of the 7Li/6Li ratio outside the inner solar system would be very                                                
important.                                                                                                                        
  The 12C/13C ratio in the gaseous coma of comets has been found to be > 100                                                      
(Vanysek & Rahe, 1978), somewhat larger than the terrestrial value and two to three                                               
times larger than the value found in interstellar clouds (e.g. Liszt, 1978). If this low                                          
interstellar-cloud value is due to low-temperature fractionations, as is probably true                                            
for the D/H enhancements there (Watson, 1977), a distinction between the 12C/13C                                                  
ratios in the dust and gas of comets would shed some light on interstellar gas-grain                                              
chemistry.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                  
3.4 Organic molecules                                                                                                             
  As far as molecules are concerned, it might be very interesting to look for very large                                          
molecules (or their fragments) in grains. Laboratory experiments by Greenberg and                                                 
his associates (Greenberg, 1979), who irradiated NH3 and CO-mixtures (which are                                                   
expected to form ice mantles on interstellar grains), have produced molecular material                                            
with evaporation temperatures of 400deg to 600deg K and molecular weights possibly in the                                         
thousands. Assuming that the mantles of interstellar grains consist of such photo-                                                
chemically processed material, it should be seen in cometary material rather than in                                              
meteoritic material, where they might not have survived heating during formation.

A schematic of the PIA sensor is shown in Figure 3 and a block diagram in Figure 4.                                               
  After the impact of a particulate on a solid target with a relative velocity well above                                         
1 km/s, the following effects occur:                                                                                              
 -   a crater is formed on the target                                                                                             
 -   the particulate is destroyed, to a degree depending upon the speed                                                           
 -   secondary particulates are emitted                                                                                           
 -   a light flash occurs                                                                                                         
 -   neutrals, positive and negative ions, and electrons are released.                                                            
                                                                                                                                  
The phenomenon of impact charging was first reported by Friichtenicht & Slattery                                                  
(1963), and many instruments for measuring micrometeoroid impacts in space have                                                   
been based on this phenomenon.                                                                                                    
   The positive ions are detected at the target (TG), which has a potential of + 1 kV                                             
and at the acceleration grid (AC) at -2 kV; the impact light flash is detected by the

photomultiplier (PM). These are the so-called 'front-end' channels.  As they are closest                                          
to the outside environment they may be sensitive to interference.  The photomultiplier                                            
is therefore protected against stray light by the baffle and the diaphragm PIA 4 (Fig.                                            
5).  In addition each of the front-end channels has an r.m.s. noise meter attached to                                             
its output, which generates a reference voltage level serving as the level 0 threshold                                            
in such a way as to prevent noise pulses from becoming triggers of measuring cycles.                                              
They are blanked for short (10 micro s) pulses, so that they cannot exclude triggers by                                           
short-term electromagnetic interference and by ringing.  Ringing produces an excep-                                               
tionally high noise level, which is identified by noise status comparators.  Their output                                         
is used to switch off these 'noisy channels'.  A time window of 2 micro s is opened by the                                        
first active channel.  The presence of impact-generated pulses in the other channels                                              
within this window is stored.  The number of coincidences required for a signal to start                                          
a measuring cycle is set by the operating system.

  A dynamic range of four decades is needed for 0.1 - 10 micro m particles. Such a large                                          
dynamic range could only be covered by switching the sensitivity of the amplifiers                                                
in two subranges covering a factor of 1000 each, separated by a factor of 100 (i.e.                                               
1 - 1000, 100 - 10**5). log. input.                                                                                               
     The outputs of the front-end channels are each monitored by three single-channel                                             
discriminators which are set at relative levels of X1, X10, X100 of the output                                                    
voltage, irrespective of the sensitivity selections. The lowest possible limit of the ex-                                         
periment is 5X10**-14 Cb.                                                                                                         
  Having passed the acceleration grid, the ions are decelerated by the entrance grid                                              
of the first drift tube to 1 keV flight energy. Ion lenses within this drift tube improve                                         
the transmission of the instrument. After passing through this first drift tube, the ions                                         
enter the reflector section and are diverted into the second drift tube, after which they                                         
are detected with an electron multiplier. The reflector serves as a first-order energy-                                           
focussing device, compensating for the initial energies that ions might have from the                                             
formation process (up to some 70 eV).                                                                                             
  Less exposed to the outside environment are the catcher (CA) channel, where elec-                                               
trons stemming from the impact of secondary particulates are measured, and the                                                    
monitor (MO) channel measuring the induced charges of the positive ions at the first                                              
ion lens. Both channels are subject to simultaneous sensitivity switching by the same                                             
factor as the front-end channels. Their outputs are logarithmically compressed and                                                
digitized into one 6-bit word each, thus giving a resolution of +/-10%.                                                           
  Before arriving at the multiplier, the ions have been separated in time according to                                            
their mass, forming a time-of-flight spectrum. The large dynamic range of five                                                    
decades required a new approach. A. Glasmachers at the Institute for Electronic                                                   
Design of the University of Bochum (Germany) solved the problem by exploiting the                                                 
intrinsic amplification characteristics of the multiplier (i.e. each dynode amplifies by                                          
a constant factor, depending on the voltage applied). Using the signals of dynodes 5,                                             
8, 11, 14, 17 and 20, converting them to a logarithmic output, and summing them                                                   
gives a new fast logarithmic amplifier. The absolute gain depends on the gain of the                                              
multiplier, as shown in Figure 6.                                                                                                 
  To check the actual multiplier gain, an EPID (Electric Pulse Induced Desorption)-                                               
ion generator provides two mass lines of known intensity ratio. It is located a short                                             
distance from the multiplier and activated via the AHV-command. It was successfully                                               
operated in orbit on 13 October.

modes:                                                                                                                            
-   0-15  MHz mode: An amplitude sample of the MP output is taken every

    sample and a sample of the t**2-generator is taken. A second set of samples is                                                
    taken half a mass later (minimum sample). In addition, an amplitude sample is                                                 
    taken every 1.13 micro s, if no other maximum sampling occurred

    no other sampling occurred

  Even though the instrument can cope with rates as high as 500 s**-1, it needs a                                                 
device that limits the impact range to the area from which ions can get into the sensor's                                         
time-of-flight sections. The limiting aperture has an elliptical shape, and the impact                                            
area on the target is therefore circular with a diameter of 35 mm. This 'shutter' can                                             
be varied from 5 cm**2 down to 1 mm**2, within 2.5 s. Figure 9 shows it in both                                                   
positions.                                                                                                                        
  Since surface contamination may contribute substantially to the impact-generated                                                
ions, it was mandatory to remove contaminants before mounting the target to the sen-                                              
sor. Several concepts were proposed and investigated and finally a design presented                                               
in one of the experiment definition studies (v. Hoerner, 1982) was selected. The target                                           
is a 10 micro m foil of Pt doped with 5% Ag, which is stored on one roll and moved during                                         
encounter at a speed of 0.6 mm/s. The roll is about 700 mm long and 55 mm wide.                                                   
  Before mounting the target unit, the foil was transported onto the pickup roll and                                              
then ion etched on both sides as it was moved back onto the storage roll.

autonomously. The hardware (based on a RCA 1802 microprocessor) and software                                                      
providing this capability is called 'The Operating System'. The software, which                                                   
resides in PROMs, evaluates instrument data and selects the parameters for instrument                                             
operation.                                                                                                                        
 The basic status of the instrument is one of waiting for an impact to occur. To avoid                                            
being locked in this mode, a software flag is raised every second, after which the in-                                            
strument updates its internal parameters; namely

When the data of an individual event are evaluated, formatted, characterized and                                                  
prepared for telemetry transmission, some values sampled during this process are used                                             
for  control   purposes:                                                                                                          
-    IR:       The actual 'Impact Rate', i.e. the number of events occurring per second                                           
-    IRL:      Number of events per second, larger than its X 100 threshold                                                       
-    IR4:      Number of events per second that also show a spectrum corresponding to                                             
               a class-4 to -7 event                                                                                              
-    TMR:      Number of EDFs transmitted per second                                                                              
                                                                                                                                  
Moreover, the operating system conducts regular testing of the instrument, whereby                                                
all analogue channels are stimulated with test pulses of different defined amplitudes                                             
and with proper timing.                                                                                                           
  All parameters are preset whenever the experiment is switched on. When switch-on                                                
occurs for the first time, initial values stored in the PROMs are taken. During normal                                            
experiment operation, actual values are continuously written to a section of the RAM,                                             
which is kept powered whenever the spacecraft is on. For a subsequent switch on, the                                              
values from this powered memory are taken, thereby ensuring that the experiment                                                   
comes on in the state it was in when turned off.                                                                                  
 The same process occurs on an interrupt caused by the 'watchdog' function of the                                                 
instrument, i.e. if a hardware timer is not reset by the operating system at least once                                           
per 7.7 s.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                  
Setting the coincidence request                                                                                                   
 The main criterion for real impacts, aside from the existence of a mass spectrum,                                                
of course, is that the front-end signals are coincident. As small particles may not be                                            
represented in all three channels, no coincidence is required to trigger an event under                                           
normal conditions. The coincidence request starts to come into effect if the                                                      
'IR4' > 10/s and 'IR' > 2xIR4. One additional coincidence is then requested. It is up-                                            
dated every second.                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                  
Disabling trigger channels                                                                                                        
  The front-end channels may be triggered more often than the whole system can                                                    
tolerate. In this case, the noise detection system raises the trigger level. Should this                                          
value reach more than 3.2 V, the offending channel is precluded from triggering. It is                                            
enabled again if the trigger level drops below the above value. The number of active                                              
channels is also considered for coincidence requests. Should all three front-end                                                  
channels need to be switched off, the instrument is automatically set to the low-sensitivity                                      
mode, and all front-end channels are enabled again.                                                                               
                                                                                                                                  
Setting the sensitivity                                                                                                           
  The instrument can be set into a 'HI' (high) and 'LO' (low) sensitivity mode,                                                   
whereby the channels AC/PM/TG/CA and MO are affected. It only makes sense to                                                      
select LO sensitivity if there are enough events to fill the telemetry capacity. The                                              
following criterion has been chosen for the switchover from HI to L0:                                                             
    IRL (large events) > [TMR (EDF rate)) + 3                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                  
  In addition, the shutter is caused to open, all channels are enabled, and no coincidences                                       
required. Once in the LO state, the instrument remains there for 4 s and then uncondi-                                            
tionally returns to the HI setting.                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                  
Setting the spectrum mode                                                                                                         
    The different modes for recording the mass spectrum have been described above.                                                
Mode 0 is used exclusively with Data File Section 13 for every 26th event. Selection                                              
of the other modes depends on the ratio of 'IR4' and 'TMR'. The mode number is                                                    
increased by 1 whenever IR4 >/=  2 xTMR, or 1R4> 128. It is reduced again if                                                      
IR4<2xTMR. Changes are effected after 4 s have elapsed.                                                                           
                                                                                                                                  
Shutter operation                                                                                                                 
    The shutter is a device in front of the target that controls the area that can be hit                                         
by the incoming particles. The aperture is set under microprocessor control by a step-                                            
per motor. Two switches are used to identify the 'open' (500 mm**2) and 'small'                                                   
(52.4 mm**2) positions. For technical reasons (vibration load on the switches), the                                               
'zero' position is somewhat smaller (457 mm**2). The smallest aperture (ca. 1 mm**2) is                                           
reached after 71 motor steps.                                                                                                     
  After any switch-on, the shutter opens to the 'zero' position. During experiment                                                
operation, the aperture is controlled by the IR4 (events with spectra) using the follow-                                          
ing criteria:                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                  
       IR4> 90:   close by  3 increments  IR4 <60:  open by  3 decrements                                                         
       IR4> 180:  close by  6 increments  IR4 <30:  open by  6 decrements                                                         
       IR4> 254:  close by  9 increments  IR4 <15:  open by  9 decrements                                                         
                                                                                                                                  
  -a decrement/increment being three motor steps in the range of small shutter apertures,                                         
   and 10 motor steps outside this range.                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                  
Target movement                                                                                                                   
   As mentioned above, the quality of the mass spectra largely depends on the                                                     
cleanliness of the target. Movement of the target is effected in two ways: by telecom-                                            
mand and automatically. A telecommand will be used prior to encounter to remove                                                   
the target area that has been exposed to the environment during tests and launch. Dur-                                            
ing the actual flyby, the target starts moving whenever IR4> 60 and stops when

  As only one motor should move at any time, the shutter has been given priority over                                             
the target.                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                  
Setting the multiplier high voltage                                                                                               
  The high voltage of the multiplier controls both the sensitivity and the dynamic                                                
range for the mass spectrum. There are three possible states for it:                                                              
  -   off, i.e. no high voltage at all                                                                                            
  -   low, i.e. a value of 200+nX39.7 V, where n denotes a selectable number of                                                   
      voltage increments, ranging from 0 to 63                                                                                    
      normal, i.e. a value of 2000+nX39.7 V, giving actual values between 2000 and                                                
      4500 V.                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                  
The value for the high voltage is set exclusively by telecommand. Only during execu-                                              
tion of a stimulus routine (CMD AVH) is it raised five times by 3 steps, i.e. by some                                             
600 V. In order not to lose the correct value, the register controlling the HV converter                                          
is updated each second from the main memory.

  A number of telecommands have been defined for the remote control of the instru-

The instrument system considers only commands that have the correct parity P and                                                  
address A. For correct commands, the type C defines an address in the memory and                                                  
D the data to be written to this address. The command is then executed after the next                                             
event has been processed, or after 1 s at the latest.

 The data-handling system collects all values measured by the Analyser's various                                                  
elements. The number of coincidences is read and the number of entries in the event                                               
memory and in the mass windows are checked and the class of the event is established.                                             
  Events are classified as follows:                                                                                               
 1.      events that have one front-end signal only                                                                               
 2.      events that have one coincidence between two front-end channels, but no

 3.      events that have all front-end coincidences, but no spectrum                                                             
 4.      events that have a minimum of 52/46/10 entries in the spectrum for modes 1/2/3,

 5.      events that have a minimum of 54/48/12, but not more than 228/148/140 entries

         dow(6-58u)                                                                                                               
 6.      class-5 events that have, in addition, a minimum of 2 entries of at least 1/5th                                          
         full scale between mass 5 and 8                                                                                          
 7.      class-5 events that have a minimum of 34/27/12 entries in the mass window, but                                           
         no more than 93/49/46                                                                                                    
 8.      events of the statistical sample                                                                                         
 9.      test pulses from the test-pulse sequence                                                                                 
10.      events from the AHV routine, i.e. spectra of the multiplier stimulus, the emitter                                        
 0.      events that have already been transferred to telemetry.                                                                  
                                                                                                                                  
After event classification the memory is checked for empty sections or those holding                                              
lower class data. If feasible, the data of the current event are transferred to the main                                          
memory, and the 'experiment data frame' header is added. The system then goes back                                                
into the loop, waiting for the next event to occur. Table 3 shows the layout of the ex-
