  The Halley Optical Probe Experiment (HOPE) has been designed to provide in-situ                                                 
photopolarimetric data on both the dust cloud and the gaseous atmosphere in Halley's                                              
coma. The Optical Probe's concept is presented here, together with a description of                                               
the instrumentation and the possibilities for cross-correlation between the HOPE                                                  
results and those of other space and ground-based experiments. The instrument was                                                 
turned on successfully on 13 September 1985.

  Cosmic dust observations from space probes are traditionally classified as either                                               
remote-sensing (essentially optical) or in-situ (typically mass-spectrometers or impact                                           
detectors). A third type of observation is possible with the ESA Giotto mission to                                                
Comet Halley, namely optical measurements of cometary dust and gas parameters in                                                  
volume elements centred on the moving probe (Levasseur-Regourd et al. 1981a).                                                     
  The Optical Probe's concept is shown in Figure 1. An optical measurement of the                                                 
polarized spectral radiance in the direction of motion is made at point M1 on the                                                 
spacecraft trajectory; a second measurement is then made at point M2. If the two                                                  
observations are made parallel to the direction of motion, then their difference is the                                           
spatial derivative of the radiance along the line of sight. It is a direct measure of the                                         
light scattered by the dust or emitted by the gas in a tube along the trajectory (Levasseur-                                      
Regourd et al. 1981b).                                                                                                            
  The only assumptions made are: (i) that the cometary atmosphere is optically thin                                               
(which is highly likely more than 500 km from the nucleus); and (ii) that the rapid                                               
motion of the spacecraft through the coma allows a quasi-steady-state from one                                                    
measurement set to the next.                                                                                                      
 The polarized spectral radiance can be inverted only if the viewing direction is                                                 
parallel to the trajectory, resulting in two possibilities, the direction of motion and the                                       
opposite one. The corresponding measurements differ only in scattering angle, which                                               
typically for the Giotto mission are 72.8 deg for the forward viewing direction and                                               
107.2deg for rearward viewing. Typical scattering phase diagrams such as those obtain-                                            
ed for the zodiacal cloud and in laboratory measurements are flat in the 70deg - 110deg                                           
range (Dumont 1976, Giese et al. 1978), implying that the ratio of the two polarized                                              
radiances would yield almost no information on the forward-to-backscattering ratio.                                               
A rearward-looking instrument has been selected, in view of the more critical demands                                             
of a forward-looking type.

brightnesses in various colours in the direction opposite to the direction of motion of                                           
the spacecraft through the cometary coma. Since an instrument on board a cometary                                                 
probe had to be relatively small and extremely reliable, we have chosen to have no                                                
moving parts, which has led to an instrument mass of only about 1.3 kg (Fig. 2).                                                  
  The spectral discrimination in the seven-colour refracting photopolarimeter is                                                  
achieved by imaging uniformly illuminated interference filters deposited on the objec-                                            
tive lens onto a micro-channel plate detector. The polarization is determined by the                                              
spinning spacecraft rotation (15 r.p.m.) of the polaroid analyzer; simultaneous                                                   
measurements are made for the seven channels in 0.5 s. One set of measurements,                                                   
which allows the determination of the total intensities, the polarized brightnesses, the                                          
azimuths of the polarized components (i.e. the Stokes parameters) and their errors,                                               
corresponds to a 180 deg rotation of the analyzer; it is performed every 2 s.

 The layout of the optical system is illustrated in Figure 3. It is composed of an f/1.7                                          
objective lens of 18 mm diameter, seven interference filters (Table 1), a polaroid foil,                                          
a field stop, a field lens and a micro-channel plate photomultiplier. The filter mosaic                                           
is designed to provide comparable intensities for the various channels and a partial cor-                                         
rection of the aberrations. The field of view for each channel is 3 deg. Cross-talk may                                           
exist between the various channels, due to diffusion inside the filter mosaic, misalign-                                          
ment between optics and detector, or electronic cross-talk; total cross-talk has been                                             
found to be less than 3%.                                                                                                         
 The linearity calibration was performed at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy                                                
in Heidelberg. It allowed determination of the degree of linearity for individual counts                                          
by a boot-strap method. This Individual Linearity Ratio (ILR) is defined for a given                                              
count as the ratio of counts measured to counts expected, i.e. if a stimulus results in                                           
a count C1, and another stimulus results in a count C2 (where C1 is approximately                                                 
equal to C2), the combination of the first and second stimuli results in a count C3.                                              
Then if the system is behaving linearly, C1 + C2 = C3. The ratio of C3 to the sum of                                              
C1 and C2 defines the ILR for the count (C1 + C2)/2. These ILRs were determined for                                               
all channels. A least-squares curve was then fitted to the ILR vs counts for each chan-                                           
nel. The product of successive values of the ILR yields the linearity ratio, which is                                             
then used to correct the measured counts of our system.                                                                           
  The cross-talk measurements were also mainly carried out in Heidelberg using a                                                  
Jarrell Ash dual 1 m monochromator. In this set-up, a light beam is passed through                                                
the monochromator with a dispersion of about 0.1 nm and the response of the instru-                                               
ment noted in all channels. These measurements were repeated for numerous                                                         
wavelengths. The results were integrated across each bandpass and then compared                                                   
with the integrated signal received in the out-of-bandpass channels. The outband and                                              
inband counts were corrected by applying a preliminary linearity ratio derived as a                                               
composite of all channels. The outband and inband counts corrected in this way for                                                
linearity were then used to determine the preliminary cross-talk. This cross-talk was                                             
then used to correct the linearity ratios. The improved linearities were then used to                                             
correct the cross-talk. This cross-talk was subsequently used to correct the linearity                                            
ratios, and finally the improved linearity ratio was used to finalize the correction to                                           
the cross-talk. The application of this finalized cross talk to the linearity ratio did not                                       
result in any material change and the iteration process was therefore terminated.

Sunlight diffused by the cometary dust will be measured over a wide wavelength                                                    
range, from the blue to the red, in three gas-free emission bands: 439-448 nm,                                                    
565-585 nm and 714-721 nm. Of great importance is the fact that there are two                                                     
wavelengths in common between the Giotto HMC camera and the HOPE instrument,                                                      
and one wavelength in common between the USSR Vega probe camera and HOPE                                                          
(Fig. 4), providing the possibility of cross-checking.                                                                            
 Light emitted by the cometary gases will be measured in four spectral bands. The                                                 
OH emission band at 307 nm has been chosen as a tracer of H2O molecules. CN at                                                    
387 nm and C2 at 514 nm are the dominant minor species emissions in the optical                                                   
range; they could be representative of some carbon chemistry in the coma. CO+ at                                                  
426 nm will allow the penetration of the solar wind to be studied throughout the coma,

are mainly aimed at the study of the optical properties of dust grains. They also carry                                           
information on the production processes of the gaseous species; ground-based obser-

those species being produced in an excited state in the inner coma.

spacecraft, in the shadow of the solar panels. It is, nevertheless, necessary to baffle                                           
the instrument against light coming from the cometary coma outside the field of view,                                             
and reflected by Giotto's main antenna or tripod during the flyby. A 270 mm long baf-                                             
fle with seven vanes has therefore been designed and incorporated. The total system                                               
stray-light suppression is about 10**-12, as long as the flight sources are at least 1.5deg                                       
from the instrument's optical axis. The possibility that specularly reflecting sources                                            
might direct sunlight into the baffle has been studied during solar simulation testing                                            
of the spacecraft.                                                                                                                
  A self-luminescent white source of moderate intensity is mounted on the back of the                                             
baffle cover; it has been used during the tests and during the Giotto spacecraft cruise                                           
phase. The cover was released in October 1985 by means of a pyrotechnic device. In-                                               
flight calibration is provided via this calibration source, and by the background sky                                             
radiation (zodiacal light + star light) to be observed immediately prior to encounter.

  Multicolour brightnesses and polarizations will be obtained in volume elements                                                  
along the trajectory of the Probe throughout Halley's coma. The tubes will be 140 km                                              
long (corresponding to 2 s in the encounter data take) and 7 km wide (corresponding                                               
to the 3 deg field of view of the instrument). For the dust, HOPE provides six values                                             
(three wavelengths X two states of polarization) of the product of the local density and                                          
the differential scattering cross-section. It should be possible to distinguish changes                                           
in density from changes in cross-section and five values of the normalized cross-                                                 
section are obtained. One has, nevertheless, to be aware of possible ambiguities in                                               
order to arrive at proper interpretation of the data, especially in the regime of large                                           
irregular dust grains which might show similar relative scattering functions, somewhat                                            
independent of size (Weiss-Wrana K, 1983). Generally, however, if the normalized                                                  
cross-sections do not vary from one point to the next, any change in the local polarized                                          
radiance is a direct measurement of a change in the dust number density; discrete                                                 
features (jets) will be obvious if the optical properties do not change dramatically                                              
in these jets. If the normalized cross-sections vary, severe constraints will be imposed                                          
on optical properties.  Dust number densities will be derived from laboratory results on                                          
dust scattering properties and modelling, developed at Ruhr Universitat, Bochum, Laboratoire                                      
d'Astronomie Spatiale, and the Space Astronomy Laboratory (Levasseur-Regourd et al. 1983).                                        
  Figure 5 shows how various grain-size intervals contribute to the brightness                                                    
integral. The lower curve obtained using Mie theory indicates that the size intervals                                             
(0.121 - 1.5 micro m) and (1.5-70 micro m) contribute equally to the overall integral; the upper                                  
curve, obtained using a combination of Mie theory for small grains (</= 70 micro m) and                                           
the Perrin-Lamy model (Perrin J M & Lamy P L, 1983) of rough particles for larger grains,                                         
suggests that grains larger than 70 micro m may contribute to enhance the brightness integral.                                    
Table 2 shows how colour should behave for three HOPE dust channels, taking the fourth one                                        
(445 nm) as a reference. The red channel indicates the possibility of distinguishing between

  A simulation has been made to prepare the restitution method. For the dust, the                                                 
Perrin-Lamy model was used, while for gases a Festou-Zucconi model was                                                            
employed (Festou M & Zucconi J M, 1984). The solar flux scattered along the                                                       
rearward-looking line of sight was integrated every 0.5 s. Then, the zodiacal background                                          
was added and the overall intensity was partially modulated to simulate the polarization.                                         
Afterwards, the stellar background and, for the gas channels only, the estimated polarized                                        
gas signals, were added. We also included stray light, cross-talk, telemetry noise and                                            
telemetry breakdown. Typical results are presented in Figure 6. This simulation allows the                                        
ultimate precision of the inversion technique to be estimated as a function of the global                                         
noise level.                                                                                                                      
   In conclusion, with the HOPE experiment we seek to:                                                                            
 -  determine the changes in both number density (including inhomogeneities) and the                                              
    grain-size distribution as a function of the Probe's position inside the coma                                                 
 -  determine the spatial distribution along the trajectory of emissions due to OH,                                               
    CN, C2 and CO+, in order to derive the production rates of the parent species,                                                
    as well as their nature, and to obtain information on the physical processes leading                                          
    to the formation of the observed radicals by means of the study of the polarization                                           
    of their emissions as a function of the distance of the nucleus                                                               
 -  investigate the dynamical coupling of gas and dust by determining the gas-to-dust                                             
    mass production ratio as a function of the distance and the possible correlations                                             
    with grain sizes                                                                                                              
 -  compare the optical properties of cometary dust with those of interplanetary and                                              
    interstellar grains, in an effort to understand the histories and mutual interactions                                         
    of all three dust complexes.                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                  
The experiment should also provide the necessary link between in-situ and remote                                                  
measurements with regard to spatial changes through the coma. It has been suggested                                               
to the International Halley Watch (IHW) that ground-based observations should be                                                  
made at HOPE wavelengths: in addition HOPE team members will make supporting

  From a comparison of in-situ dust-detector measurements and HOPE experiment                                                     
results, the following relationships should be determined: dust number density and
