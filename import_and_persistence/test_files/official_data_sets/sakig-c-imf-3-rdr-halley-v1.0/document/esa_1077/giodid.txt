Abstract                                                                                                                          
   The Dust Impact Detection System (DIDSY) consists of six independent subsystems                                                
with the primary aim of registering the impacts of all particulates of significant mass                                           
incident on the probe during the post-perihelion encounter with Comet Halley in 1986.                                             
Mounted on Giotto's front dust shield, the detectors will determine the mass spectrum                                             
of the dust, with a limiting sensitivity of some 10**-17 g, increasing to the largest grain                                       
masses encountered along Giotto's trajectory through the cometary environment with                                                
an ultimate spatial resolution of some 70 km. An additional detector is located on the                                            
rear shield to monitor those dust particles (m > ~ 5 X 10**-7 g) that are able to                                                 
penetrate the front dust shield. An ambient plasma monitor is also incorporated into                                              
DIDSY to measure the impact plasma generated by both dust and gas impacts on the                                                  
spacecraft. The system is controlled and its data processed by a microprocessor-based                                             
system that allows the wide range of anticipated impact rates (varying from a few per                                             
minute, to ~ 10**6 s**-1 at closest approach) to be handled. The instrument weighs                                                
2.26 kg and consumes 1.9 W of power during normal operation.                                                                      
                                                                                                                                  
1. Scientific Objectives                                                                                                          
  The mass efflux from a comet generally consists of two quite separate components,                                               
which are distinguished by the Type-I (gas) and Type-II (dust) tails under differentia-                                           
tion by the interplanetary environment. The relative importance of the two is variable                                            
but, as a general guide, 30% of this efflux is in the form of solid particles. Some may                                           
be ice grains which sublimate within a short period of release. Since all comet observa-                                          
tions have been remote to date, knowledge of the particulate mass distribution is iden-                                           
tified as one of the most fundamental of measurements of cometary behaviour to be                                                 
undertaken by the Giotto mission. This conclusion can be drawn both from the point                                                
of view of the cometary physics, and from the role of comets as the prime source of                                               
interplanetary dust within the solar system.                                                                                      
  Measurement in the cometary encounter phase is simplified by the head-on en-                                                    
counter direction of dust and a very accurately known impact speed of 69 km/s. The                                                
dusty coma and tail will be comparatively static during the encounter, since velocities                                           
in the frame of reference of Comet Halley are typically only 0.5 km/s. Measurement                                                
and system development are made very difficult by the extreme variability of the impact                                           
rate, which varies approximately inversely as the square of the distance of the probe                                             
from the comet, and by the highly unpredictable nature of the dust fluxes. Such varia-                                            
tions illustrate very clearly the need for in-situ detection, the only means whereby a                                            
reliable model can be determined.                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                  
1.1 In-situ cometary particulate measurements                                                                                     
   Although the approach to a comet is an entirely new venture in the space sciences                                              
and in the exploration of the solar system, cometary dust is a common enough consti-                                              
tuent of the solar system and has even been recovered terrestrially (Brownlee, 1978).                                             
  Observations of the comet's dust tail yield a line-of-sight, integrated scattering func-                                        
tion for the entire dust population effective in this process. However, the motion of                                             
the dust, and hence its distribution in the expanding tail, is differentiated both by the                                         
dynamics of gas acceleration processes acting away from the evaporative region, and                                               
also by the subsequent balance in dynamics between gravitational forces and solar                                                 
radiation pressure.                                                                                                               
  Analysis of the motion of such particles was initiated by Bessel (1836). By extending                                           
theory, and in particular the calculation of isophotes, Finson & Probstein (1968) were                                            
able to utilize the observations of Comet Arend-Roland and derive data relevant to the                                            
particle size distribution. Although their observations suggested a minimum size                                                  
'cut-off' in the region of 1 micro m diameter, this inference is erroneous because of the                                         
very small contribution of these particles compared with the larger particles of 10 micro m.                                      
In-situ spacecraft data confirm this effect for the Zodiacal Cloud at l AU heliocentric                                           
distance, where the actual size distribution is found to extend to the region of 0.01 micro m                                     
particle size. Such a lack of positive direct observations from comets is obviously a                                             
significant shortcoming in the modelling of flux rates, but from the point of view of                                             
assuring the science objectives of the experiment. In-situ detection of cometary par-                                             
ticles must extend to the smallest of detectable particles.  Although it is known that in-                                        
terplanetary space hosts these very small masses, it is not clear whether these are                                               
directly expelled from comets or are the products of impact comminution of the larger                                             
meteoroid stream particles as they decay towards the Sun in their Pointing-Robertson                                              
spiral. First postulated by Zook & Berg (1975), they are then expelled from the solar                                             
system as beta meteoroids. Comparison of the size distribution of fresh cometary dust                                             
and the equilibrated interplanetary dust will be one of the rich returns of the Goitto                                            
mission. We also know, from the terrestrial observations of the Aquarid (May) and                                                 
Orionid (October) meteor streams, the size distribution of the larger meteoroids ac-                                              
tually expelled from Comet Halley (Hughes, 1978). We will measure these actual                                                    
masses directly from the Giotto Meteoroid Shield Momentum (MSM) Subsystem and                                                     
determine their size distribution index, so as to be able to deduce the decay                                                     
mechanisms operative in metcor streams after ejection from a comet.                                                               
   From the point of view of forces on cometary grains, differentiation occurs accord-                                            
ing to (i) an area-to-mass ratio during cometary expulsion and gas drag acceleration,                                             
and (ii) an albedo-to-mass ratio in subsequent tail development motion. This leads                                                
to models of the time-dependence of the impact rate and size distribution during en-                                              
counter which have considerably different profiles. The DIDSY determination of the                                                
size distribution along the whole encounter trajectory with a mass range potentially                                              
extending from 10**-17 g to 10**-3 g is expected to offer very strong discrimination                                              
against those models that do not assume the 'correct' parameters for Comet Halley's                                               
grains. Evaporation of the icy filling of the matrix of fluffy grains can also lead to                                            
observational differences, and from the penetration of the Impact Plasma and Momen-

ty of the grains.                                                                                                                 
 It is generally believed that, close to the cometary nucleus (up to 20 R(nuc)), particles                                        
are accelerated by the outstreaming gas. Ice particles are completely or partly                                                   
evaporated by the Sun's radiation. Measuring the size distribution of cometary par-                                               
ticles at various distances from the nucleus and comparing this with evaporation                                                  
models should therefore allow the determination of certain material properties of ice                                             
particles (e.g. latent heat of ices). References to detailed modelling of the particulate                                         
environment are published by Divine (1981), Hellmich & Keller (1981) and Fertig &                                                 
Schwehm (1984). Other aspects of modelling relevant to cometary intercept missions                                                
are offered by Carey et al. (1984).                                                                                               
 Cometary rotation also strongly influences modelling. From Comet Swift-Tuttle,                                                   
Sekanina (1981) deduces the location of active emission regions comprising only a                                                 
small fraction of the total area; these would relate in their activity to the rotation speed                                      
and quite intense forward jetting of dust away from the comet may be observed. Such                                               
anisotropies, and in particular the pre- and post-encounter anisotropies, will be strong-                                         
ly reflected in the DIDSY activity profile.                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                  
2. System Design                                                                                                                  
  The DIDSY system has been designed so that, as far as possible, the individual sub-                                             
systems may operate independently of each other for operational reliability. At the                                               
same time, by operating in overlapping ranges of incident particle mass, comparison                                               
of results from the different subsystems will yield greater 'scientific' reliability.                                             
Despite independent operation, some coincidence information for individual impacts                                                
is exchanged between Subsystems for event validation. However, the failure of one                                                 
detection subsystem should not in any way affect the correct operation of another. The                                            
Central Data Formatter (CDF) performs a primary task of collecting data from each                                                 
subsystem, processing it as required, and passing it into the telemetry stream. In addi-                                          
tion to handling data formatting, the CDF also supplies power to each subsystem via                                               
a separate current-limiter so that, for example, a short-circuit in one subsystem does                                            
not affect operation of the others. Unregulated power is supplied by the spacecraft                                               
power subsystem on a single current-tripped supply.                                                                               
  A buffered star-type interface is used between the CDF and the sensor subsystems;                                               
failure on any subsystem does not result in total system failure. The interface operates                                          
in a mainly digital manner, each subsystem digitizing its data before passing them to                                             
the CDF. In addition, some analogue channels provide housekeeping information (i.e.                                               
supply voltages, temperatures, etc.) and also give a limited amount of scientific data.                                           
In the unlikely event of failure of the data formatting part of the CDF, some limited                                             
data on impact rates are still available.                                                                                         
  Data within the DIDSY subsystem are divided into two broad categories, namely:                                                  
(i) discrete data, which represent a set of measured values for a single event detected                                           
by one subsystem, and (ii) cumulative data, which represent the total event amplitude                                             
distribution from each sensor and are generated by accumulation of discrete data                                                  
events within the CDF. Such an approach results from the telemetry allocation, which                                              
makes it impossible to transmit full information on all detected impacts, except at very                                          
low impact rates. A limited quantity of discrete data are mixed with the cumulative                                               
data and passed into the spacecraft telemetry stream by the CDF every 1.3 s during                                                
the last hour before closest approach and every 2.83 s prior to this. A brief description                                         
of the constituent elements of the DIDSY system is given in Table 1.

 The MSM and RSM sensors and subsystem were designed and developed by the                                                         
Unit for Space Sciences at the University of Kent at Canterbury. The Rutherford Ap-                                               
pleton Laboratory was responsible for the major part of the acoustic design of the front                                          
shield.                                                                                                                           
  Three 200 kHz longitudinally resonant PZT 5A piezoelectric microphone elements                                                  
attached to the rear of the spacecraft front shield and constitute the detectors for                                              
MSM subsystem. Each crystal is contained in a hermetically sealed stainless-steel                                                 
assembly, connection being made through a miniature co-axial connector. Each sensor                                               
is attached to the front shield by two titanium bolts in insulating bushes; a kapton                                              
washer maintains isolation between sensor and spacecraft grounds. The bolts are                                                   
tightened to a torque of 30 cNm, this value having been found to give peak output                                                 
amplitude.                                                                                                                        
  For nonpenetrating impacts on the front shield, there is an initial momentum im-                                                
pulse some 11 times the incident particle momentum. The output pulse amplitude is                                                 
related to both mass and velocity, but since the velocity of impacting particles during                                           
Halley encounter is essentially constant at 69 km/s, pulse amplitude is proportional                                              
to incident mass.                                                                                                                 
  Impacts upon the spacecraft rear kevlar shield are sensed by a fourth (RSM) sensor                                              
identical to those on the front shield, fixed onto the rear shield by two bolts which                                             
screw into threaded inserts. It is positioned underneath the small sector of the front                                            
shield. The RSM electronics subsystem is treated as a fourth channel of the MSM.                                                  
 The original proposal (McDonnell et al., 1981) described three sensors sym-                                                      
metrically placed at 120deg intervals on the periphery of a one-piece front shield, which                                         
was 'clean' with respect to the propagation of flexural waves from localized impacts                                              
on the metal plate. A triangulation technique was proposed for estimating the actual                                              
location of each impact in order to determine the momentum and mass of the incident                                               
particle. As the spacecraft shield design evolved, it became clear that the front shield                                          
would not be an acoustically 'clean' structure.                                                                                   
 A programme of laboratory measurements was carried out to estimate the perfor-                                                   
mance of different shield designs (Burton, 1983; Reading & Ridgeley, 1983), using a                                               
high-power neodymium glass pulsed laser at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory to                                                  
simulate hypervelocity particle impacts on various shield test sections and on full-scale                                         
models of different front-shield configurations. The decay time for signals from a                                                
simulated impact event on the original front shield design was found to be excessive                                              
with consequent degradation of data at high impact rates. The results also indicated                                              
that it would not be possible to locate impact events by triangulation methods, because                                           
of the nonuniform propagation characteristics of the bumper shield, which had by now                                              
become a two-part annulus with several apertures and other structural features. These                                             
problems were resolved by isolating a 35deg sector of the annular shield which remained                                           
'clean', by introducing two 'non-conducting' radial joints. The joints use a Viton                                                
rubber-kevlar double layer sandwiched between two overlapping aluminium plates to                                                 
provide low transmission and reflectance of the propagating signals. By locating one                                              
of the momentum sensors (DID 4) on this isolated clean 35deg sector, it is then possible                                          
to obtain a relatively uniform response for reliable estimation of impact mass. A third                                           
radial joint permits assembly of the shield structure, but in this case a specially                                               
developed 'conducting' joint allows the larger sector (325deg) of the shield to be used

   The MSM/RSM electronics subsystem performs both analogue and digital process-                                                  
ing of the signals arising at each sensor from a particle impact. Measured values are                                             
passed to the CDF within DID for further processing and eventual transmission to the                                              
On-Board Data-Handling System (OBDH). The RSM is treated as a fourth channel                                                      
of the MSM subsystem.                                                                                                             
 A block diagram of the MSM/RSM electronics subsystem is shown in Figure 2. The                                                   
200 kHz component of the signal received from each piezoelectric sensor is extracted                                              
by a 600 Ohm six-pole Chebyshev filter which is corrected for cable capacitance and                                               
matches the 600 Ohm source impedance, offering a 4 dB insertion loss.                                                             
  Each signal channel employs Over-Voltage Protection (OVP) at its front end to

large particles close to the sensors; two DMOS FETs driven at their gates through

The action of both filter and OVP enables the large dynamic range of sensor output

degree of compression. A test input on each channel permits signal injection directly                                             
into the front end of each channel through a capacitively coupled 100:1 attenuator                                                
network.                                                                                                                          
  To accommodate the large dynamic range of input signals, the half-wave peak detec-                                              
tor within each channel operates from two input sources. For signal levels below ap-                                              
proximately 200 mV, two stages of amplification precede detection by a single diode

bypass diode connected directly to the input (after filter) handles the higher signal                                             
range; a single operational amplifier provides buffering and a maximum output

capacitor.                                                                                                                        
  The amplified signals from each of the MSM (DID 2,3,4) channels are buffered,

activity for use as an analogue science channel, which is passed to the spacecraft.                                               
  After peak detection, each channel is logarithmically amplified and scaled by a                                                 
separate precision-temperature-compensated circuit containing two operational                                                     
amplifiers, a precision-matched transistor pair and a constant current source; the input                                          
range corresponds to an output range of 0-5 V with a slope of 1 V per decade. Test                                                
outputs for each channel are taken from the output of each logarithmic amplifier; a                                               
high series resistance ensures that connections do not introduce an EMI hazard. A                                                 
shared analogue multiplexer and 8-bit ADC connected to all four channels enables the                                              
CDF, via the dedicated interface to the subsystem, to measure signals detected on each                                            
sensor channel.                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                  
Figure 2. MSM/RSM subsystem block diagram                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                  
  In parallel with the ADC circuitry, an analogue comparator connected to the output                                              
of each logarithmic amplifier compares the activity on each channel with a threshold                                              
level. The threshold level is generated for each channel by an 8-bit counter and 5 V                                              
ADC and is set after each event by the CDF via the digital interface. Once set, the                                               
counter decrements by one count every 160 micro s until it reaches zero, causing the                                              
threshold level to fall linearly at 122 V/s. The counter period is carefully chosen so                                            
that the threshold mimics (with a safe margin) the logarithmic decay of the acoustic                                              
signals received by any one sensor following a single impact on the front shield direct-                                          
ly at the sensor.                                                                                                                 
  Monostables attached to the comparator outputs cause the peak detector of each                                                  
channel to be switched to the 'hold' state for a maximum period of 3 ms following                                                 
the detection of a threshold triggering on that channel. Gating logic also attached to                                            
the comparator outputs sets an interface flag (REQ) to request CDF attention at each                                              
event. The gating logic which responds to DID 2 and DID 3 events is mode-dependent,                                               
being controlled by a CDF-set Coincidence Control (or mode) Register within the sub-                                              
system, and is able to operate in one of four modes (see Section 6.7). After the CDF                                              
has 'read' the digitized signal value for each event, it signals completion by pulsing                                            
an interface flag (ACK), the request is cleared, the peak detectors are switched back                                             
to the track state and the subsystem is ready to detect another 'event' which exceeds                                             
the falling threshold level.                                                                                                      
  A Timing-Word Register (TWR) within the subsystem indicates the order in which                                                  
the comparators on each MSM channel were triggered. A 30 micro s monostable on each                                               
comparator output feeds a priority encoder which encodes the channel number into                                                  
two bits and clocks them along a dual-shift register. The shift register is made                                                  
available through three-state buffers with the bits re-arranged so that they clock in                                             
pairs from bit 2 to bit 7. An RSM coincidence flag appears in bit 1 and a CIS coin-                                               
cidence flag (from the CIS electronics subsystem) appears in bit 0. The decoding of                                               
the TWR is shown in Figure 3.

ambient plasma production provided by ESA Space Science Dept.                                                                     
  The sensor is attached to the front shield of the Giotto spacecraft, which has a cut                                            
out to allow dust particles to impinge directly on the sensors. One of the impact ioniz-                                          
tion detectors (IPM-P sensor B) is covered by a 2.5 micro m thick, aluminized mylar film                                          
while the other (IPM-P sensor A) is open. Since the penetration limit of the film                                                 
depends on both the mass and density (Pailer & Grun, 1980) - the impact speed dur-                                                
ing the Halley flyby is fixed at 69 km/s - the specific density of particulates can                                               
therefore be estimated from the comparison of the count rates on both sensors (Grun                                               
& McDonnell, 1983). The charges produced on impact on the gold-plated target plate                                                
are collected by two oppositely biased (+/- 30 V) electrodes in front of the target plate                                         
(Fig. 4). Charge signals of both polarity are amplified and processed by the elec-                                                
tronics. The piezoelectric crystal is mounted onto the back of the target plate of both                                           
impact ionization detectors. It registers, in coincidence with these detectors, impacts                                           
of larger dust particles. A cross-calibration between impact ionization and acoustic                                              
detection is thereby provided. The plasma probe (IPM-A) consists of a 1 cm**2 gold-                                               
plated electrode which measures the plasma mainly induced by cometary dust and                                                    
neutral gas impacting onto its surface. Besides being a diagnostic tool for analyz-                                               
ing the ambient plasma, this probe also provides a means of assessing the effects of                                              
the induced background plasma on the operation of the impact ionization detectors.                                                
                                                                                                                                  
 4.2 Mechanical configuration                                                                                                     
  The main constraints imposed by the Giotto mission on the design of the flight in-                                              
strument have been the large expected temperature range (-50deg C to +125deg C for the                                            
IPM sensor), low weight, acoustic isolation of the sensor from the spacecraft body,                                               
and low electrical capacitance of the sensor. These requirements were met by the im-                                              
plementation of suitable manufacturing processes and by extensive testing on                                                      
dedicated test models.                                                                                                            
  The IPM sensor is mounted on the outer spacecraft shield, while the electronics are                                             
located in the DID electronics box (DID 6) on the main platform inside the spacecraft.                                            
The IPM sensor is made from a frame constructed of an aluminium alloy, which is                                                   
machined in such a way so as to reduce weight as much as possible whilst still main-                                              
taining the necessary stiffness and strength. To achieve the necessary acoustic                                                   
decoupling between the front shield and the acoustic detector fixed to the IPM target                                             
plate, the frame is supported by four damping pedestals, which are mounted to the                                                 
back of the front shield in such a way that a cut-out in the shield allows dust and plasma                                        
to reach the sensitive areas of the IPM sensor. The acoustic-damping pedestals permit                                             
a damping-factor adjustment upon integration in the spacecraft. The operating                                                     
temperature range of the damping capability is -90deg C to +150deg C. This has been                                               
achieved by using silicone rubber O-rings supported by aluminium-alloy pilots as a                                                
damping medium.                                                                                                                   
  The frame supports the target plate of the sensor; the latter is manufactured from                                              
a flat, 1.5 mm-thick aluminium-alloy plate. The edge profile of the target plate has                                              
been tapered for optimum response from the acoustic detector. Acoustic isolation be-                                              
tween target and frame has been attained by using a high-viscosity silicone compound                                              
                                                                                                                                  
Figure 4. IPM (DID 1) sensor schematic                                                                                            
including IPM-A, M and P                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                  
together with the above-mentioned edge profile. Two square, high-purity, 0.1 mm                                                   
thick gold foils are glued to the target plate in order to achieve maximum impaction                                              
yields. Eight screws help to guarantee the electrical and mechanical connection to the                                            
target plate. The target is kept firmly in place by G11 epoxy and the charge collector                                            
with an epoxide adhesive and secured by an additional bridging clamp bolted to the                                                
target plate. The target is firmly kept in place by G11 epoxy and the charge collector                                            
assembly, which is screwed to the frame. The collector assembly is made from two                                                  
sheets of G11 glass-reinforced epoxy resin. After cutting the slits and gold coating the                                          
bottom collector and top shielding surfaces, both sheets are bonded together like a                                               
multilayer printed-circuit board. The charge collector assembly of sensor B is covered                                            
by a 2.5 micro m thick mylar film, which is coated with 0.16 micro m of aluminium on the in-                                      
side surface. Solithane 113 is used for glueing the coated mylar to the top collector                                             
surface. Provision is made to connect the aluminium coating to the shielding surfaces                                             
of the collector electrically.                                                                                                    
  The plasma probe IPM-A, visible between the two IPM-P sensors (see frontispiece),                                               
was manufactured from glass-reinforced epoxy, similar to multilayer printed-circuit                                               
board. A 1 cm**2, circular, gold-plated charge-collecting electrode (and electric guard                                           
-17V) is exposed in the centre of the collector strip. The rest of the surface is gold-                                           
plated and grounded. During launch and the initial phase of interplanetary cruise, the                                            
cut-out in the bumper shield for the IPM sensor is covered by a spring-loaded                                                     
multilayer roll-up cover. All front-end passive electrical components are located in a                                            
small electronics box at the side of the IPM sensor. All electrical connections to the                                            
IPM sensor are made through a connector at the bottom of the electronics box and in-                                              
clude six shielded lines for the signals and six lines for bias voltages and ground.

4.3 IPM-P                                                                                                                         
  The signals from the IPM-P sensors (A and B) are processed in parallel. In this way,                                            
no dead-time is introduced on one sensor if the other is busy. Figure 5 shows a block                                             
diagram of the IPM-P subsystem electronics. For each sensor, the signals from both                                                
the positively (electrons) and negatively (ions) biased charge collectors are amplified                                           
in charge-sensitive preamplifiers (CSA). The peaks are detected and held while the                                                
amplitudes are converted to digital numbers in 6-bit analogue-to-digital converters.                                              
The conversion time for each event (i.e. signals exceeding the detection threshold                                                
2.5 X 10**-14C) on one or both charge collectors] is <= 500 micro s. If both ion and electron                                     
signals occur within 20 micro s of each other, a coincidence flag is raised. This has been                                        
found to be true for all dust impact events and it is therefore an indicator for this type                                        
of event.                                                                                                                         
  A typical analogue-to-digital scheme covers the charge range from 2.5 X 10**-14C to                                             
2.5 X 10**-8 C with a resolution of 40%; individual charge-measuring channels may                                                 
deviate by 20% from each other. To each 6-bit amplitude word, two more bits are                                                   
added in order to complete an 8-bit data word. The four 8-bit words constitute a set                                              
of IPM-P discrete data. The electron-ion coincidence of sensor A and B is indicated                                               
in the least significant bits (LSB) of words 1 and 3, respectively. If, within 150 micro s                                        
after this coincidence, an IPM-M signal has been detected, bits 2 of words 1 or 3 are                                             
set to 'one'. A coincidence between any signal on sensor A and B within 0.5 micro s is                                            
indicated in the LSB of word 4. This coincidence indicates a noise event, which has                                               
stimulated the electronics of both sensors. Once every 16 data gathering intervals,                                               
calibration pulses are generated and fed into the front end of the signal-processing                                              
channels; data from these calibration pulses are identified by the two last bits of word                                          
2.  Alternating large and small amplitude calibration pulses are generated. The                                                   
stimulated electron and ion signals occur in coincidence and therefore the LSBs of                                                
words 1 and 4 are set to 'one'. After each event (i.e. threshold exceeded on one of                                               
the four IPM-P charge-measuring channels), a request flag is set. Within 4 to 10 micro s,                                         
the CDF reads out the four IPM-P discrete data words for further processing. If an                                                
electron ion coincidence is set for this event, then no further event can overwrite these                                         
data before they are read out. No coincidence data are overwritten by subsequent                                                  
events. In this way, up to 250 discrete events can be read out per second.                                                        
  Eight 8-bit counters per sensor count coincident events in different amplitude (ion

pacts at times when the impact rate is too high to allow the transmission of all impacts                                          
per Data-Gathering Interval (DGI) with their complete information (discrete events).                                              
The DIDSY CDF further processes the information received from the IPM-P elec-                                                     
tronics, as described in Section 6.8. Impact events are expected to occur in categories                                           
2 to 5, while noise events are transmitted as categories 6 and 7 (see Section 6.8). One                                           
event (always the last one) of each category or category combination (i.e. 1,6,7) is                                              
transmitted during each data-gathering interval.                                                                                  
  Additionally, each event of categories 2 to 7 is counted into four different amplitude                                          
range counters. The counter is determined by the corresponding ion amplitude value.                                               
The four amplitude ranges are digits 1 through 7, 8 through 17, 18 through 31 and                                                 
32 through 63. These 24 counters accumulate up to 255 events of a given category                                                  
and amplitude range per data-gathering interval.

  The IPM-M electronics subsystem performs both analogue and digital processing of                                                
signals generated by the piezoelectric microphone mounted on the IPM (DID 1) sensor                                               
target plate. In many respects, the hardware is similar in concept and realization to                                             
that of the MSM/RSM electronics subsystem described above.                                                                        
  A block diagram of the IPM-M electronics subsystem is shown in Figure 6. Filtering

ed using a 300 Ohm matched five-pole Chebyshev filter with a 4 dB insertion loss, which                                           
is again corrected for cable capacitance.                                                                                         
  Over-Voltage Protection (OVP) is provided at the front end. Two back-to-back                                                    
stacked pairs of small signal transistors provide a sharp knee at signal levels of 1.4 V,                                         
which meets the voltage compliance requirements of the sensitive front end whilst

via a capacitively coupled 100:1 attenuator test input network.                                                                   
  After filtering, a two-stage preamplifier provides buffering and 33 X voltage gain.                                             
A 200 kHz, single-stage, Twin-T active filter with Q=4 improves the system signal-                                                
to-noise ratio by about 7 dB and provides 11 X voltage gain. A two-stage peak detector

first peak detector stage and the Twin-T filter aids stability. An analogue-science out-                                          
put based upon 100 micro s detection and 3 s integration is passed to the spacecraft.  A                                          
logarithmic amplifier compresses the detected signal to a 0-5 V range and scales it                                               
to 1 V per decade prior to digitization. A test output is taken from the output of the                                            
logarithmic amplifier.                                                                                                            
  An analogue comparator on the output of the peak detector provides coincidence in-                                              
formation to IPM-P by triggering a l ms monostable pulse for each output signal that                                              
exceeds 1 mV. The maximum delay between a particle impact and coincidence signal

Following an event or the receipt of a coincidence pulse from IPM-P, the peak detector                                            
is switched to the track state for approximately 1 ms.

an 8-bit register. Upon detection of an impact or receipt of a coincidence signal, the                                            
register contents are frozen, making a pre-event value related to the acoustic noise en-

The 8-bit telemetry digitization yields a nominal resolution of 5% over most of the                                               
sensitive range of 10**-6 to 0.3 A/m**2.

  The efflux envelope of the spacecraft transfer propulsion system includes the sen-                                              
sitive surface of the IPM sensor. Due to the conditions prevailing at the time of engine                                          
ignition, the sensor surface would be cold; there is therefore a high probability that                                            
products of combustion would be deposited on the sensor surface, causing significant                                              
deterioration in performance.                                                                                                     
  Spacecraft resources precluded the conventional approach of a motor-driven latching                                             
cover. The solution adopted meets the constraints imposed and also improves                                                       
the thermal environment of the IPM. The design utilizes a three-layer thermal blanket,                                            
which has three embedded, flat strip spring elements. When released, the cover is roll-                                           
ed up compactly to one side of the sensor aperture (Fig. 8). During launch and for                                                
the greater part of the cruise phase of the mission, the cover is extended over the sen-                                          
sor and held in place by a short length of nylon filament, which passes over a heater                                             
wire. The release operation consists simply of melting through the filament. A spring                                             
loaded carrier ensures consistent contact between the heater wire and filament; as the                                            
melting operation proceeds, the heater wire cuts through the filament.                                                            
  Since no data lines are available to confirm release, use is made of a sensor-mounted                                           
thermistor to sense the change in temperature as solar radiation falls on the sensor                                              
through the open aperture. Incorporation into the cover design of the thermal blanket                                             
results in an improved thermal environment for the sensor.

  This sensor measures the spatial distribution of dust particles in the 1-5 micro m range;                                       
such particles form a major part of the comet and meteorite dust distribution. The                                                
measurement range is intermediate between those of the IPM-P and RSM sensors. The                                                 
CIS sensor subsystem was designed and developed at ONE/CERT, Toulouse with

ticle whose mass exceeds a threshold value. This type of sensor has previously been                                               
used in space for detecting micrometeoroids, in particular for the Pegasus series of                                              
satellites (Broderick, 1968; Dozier, 1966). The detection threshold can be determined                                             
precisely. The operational reliability is good and the technology is relatively simple.

For the Giotto mission, although the impact velocity is very high (of the order of                                                
69 km/s), it is well known, and this makes it relatively simple to interpret the                                                  
measurements.                                                                                                                     
  The detailed construction of the CIS sensor is shown in Figure 9. It comprises a                                                
20 micro m thick aluminium sheet bonded onto 25 micro m kapton dielectric whose opposite                                          
face has a 1000 A vacuum-deposited coating of aluminium. The system forms a                                                       
100 nF capacitor with a 1000 cm**2 surface area.                                                                                  
  The sensor is bonded to the outer face of the spacecraft front shield with a 10 micro m                                         
insulating kapton layer, using an adhesive capable of withstanding the high                                                       
temperatures that may be experienced during the mission. The sensor thickness was                                                 
chosen such that the detection threshold occurs at particle mass of approximately                                                 
10**-10 g at the expected cometary flyby velocity. The many studies made on high-                                                 
velocity impacts (Pailer & Grun, 1980; Igenbergs et al., 1982; Mandeville, 1979;

tion limits of the IPM-P 2.5 micro m aluminium penetration foil and the Giotto front shield                                       
respectively.                                                                                                                     
 The usable surface area of the sensor was chosen to obtain a significant number of                                               
impacts far from the cometary core and to avoid saturation during the final phase of                                              
the mission. The CIS subsystem contained in the DID 6 electronics box includes a                                                  
discharge signal-shaping circuit with a fixed detection threshold, a pulse counter and                                            
a sensor charge circuit with a time delay and current limiter. The intermediate elec-                                             
trode of the capacitor is charged from the DID power converter, using a fixed 50 V                                                
(no load) supply. The top electrode of the sensor is connected to the experiment                                                  
ground so that the potential on the outer part of the sensor is close to that of the satellite                                    
structure (see Fig. 9). The CDF reads the 8-bit counter four times per DGI.                                                       
 The count rate is limited to about 1000 impacts by the recharge time and by the use                                              
of a fixed, known dead time of about 1 ms. The actual impact rate may be calculated                                               
from the recorded count using:                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                  
 R = N/(1 - NT)                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                  
where R is the real impact rate, N the recorded impact rate and T the dead time.                                                  
 An analogue channel measures the mean voltage across the capacitor, providing a                                                  
check on sensor operation and a signal inversely proportional to the discharge rate.                                              
 A coincidence signal is passed to the MSM/RSM subsystem to identify impacts                                                      
occurring on the CIS sensor.                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                  
5.1 Sensor operation                                                                                                              
  Depending on the impact conditions, one of two processes may come into play (Stor-                                              
ti et al., 1968; Laney et al., 1964).                                                                                             
  When a particle strikes or passes through the sensor, a conduction path is set up

showing the multilayer construction                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                  
which discharges the capacitor. This may be due to an electromechanical failure of                                                
the dielectric, i.e. by a compression due to the passage of a shock wave. This is true                                            
for a marginal impact having too little energy to perforate the sensor. Alternatively,                                            
it may result from the formation of a plasma, by evaporation and ionization of the sen-                                           
sor material during a partial or complete perforation. Under the high impact speeds                                               
during the Halley flyby, the second process is likely to be dominant.                                                             
  The local evaporation of the electrode materials prevents a permanent short-circuit,                                            
which would otherwise degrade the operation of the sensor. The sensor, once recharg-                                              
ed, recovers its initial properties and is ready to detect a new impact.                                                          
                                                                                                                                  
5.2 CIS performance                                                                                                               
  The sensor's operation was verified by simulating a discharge with a FET circuit                                                
triggered by a pulse generator. To verify the behaviour of the compressor circuit, a                                              
random pulse generator was used. Best results were obtained by triggering the                                                     
discharge circuit with random pulses from a radioactive source.

6.1 Circuit description                                                                                                           
  The DIDSY Central Data Formatter (CDF) outlined in Figure 10 consists of an                                                     
RCA CDP1802 CPU together with 1024 bytes of fusible-link PROM and 320 bytes                                                       
of static RAM. Interfacing with the experiment sensor subsystems is by means of                                                   
memory-mapped I/0.                                                                                                                
  In order to minimize power consumption, mass and volume, the CDF was designed                                                   
utilizing CMOS technology throughout, except for one subsystem interface where V-                                                 
MOS transistors have been used for level shifiing.                                                                                
  Flat-pack devices have been used wherever possible, but for the LSI units it was                                                
necessary to use dual-in-line variants. The power consumption of the CDF is approx-                                               
imately 100 mW from a single 5 V supply.                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                  
6.2 CDF/Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) interface                                                                                      
  The spacecraft On-Board Data Handling (OBDH) system collects bytes of experi-                                                   
ment data via the RTU and the 8-bit Data Output Register at fixed times during the                                                
spacecrafi telemetry frame. Afier the transfer of a word, the output register is loaded                                           
with the next word using the Direct Memory Access (DMA) facility of the 1802 pro-                                                 
cessor. Command of the experiment modes is via a serial-in/parallel-out shift register.                                           
Receipt of a command by the CDF causes Event Flag I of the 1802 to be asserted.

   Five bi-level status signals from the DID experiment are inserted into the

Data Formatter (CDF)                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                  
teen parameters within the experiment electronics box are monitored (fifteen supply                                               
voltages and one temperature sensor). These signals are conditioned and multiplexed                                               
within the experiment before being transferred to the RTU.                                                                        
   The CDF has been designed and programmed such that there are an integral number                                                
of experiment Data Gathering Intervals (DGI) in a spacecraft telemetry format. Tim-                                               
ing of the experiment data gathering and formatting is controlled by the DMA data-                                                
transfer function, and the process is synchronized by use of the onboard format pulse,                                            
which causes a CDF hardware reset. The first format pulse received by the CDF after                                               
power-on initializes the internal byte transfer counter and thus establishes syn-                                                 
chronism.                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                  
6.3 CDF-subsystem interfaces                                                                                                      
  The CDF communicates with the experiment subsystems via memory-mapped bi-                                                       
directional parallel ports. Each port has associated with it a number of address and                                              
handshake lines, and one of the 1802 event flags which are polled in the main program                                             
to determine when a particular subsystem requires servicing.                                                                      
                                                                                                                                  
6.4 System memory                                                                                                                 
  The CDF program is contained in two Harris HM6641 fusible link PROM devices.                                                    
The executable code occupies 96% of the available 1024 bytes with a further 3% being                                              
occupied by look-up tables.                                                                                                       
  There are 320 bytes of static RAM in the CDF, 256 bytes of which constitute the                                                 
data output buffers. 32 bytes are used exclusively for the uncompressed IPM-P                                                     
hardware-accumulated data. The remaining 32 bytes are used for a program stack and                                                
a general scratchpad area.                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                  
6.5 Operation                                                                                                                     
  At power-on and at the start of each telemetry format, the CDF receives a hardware                                              
reset. In this way any loss of synchronism between spacecraft and CDF is rectified.                                               
Digital science data are transferred from the experiment to the OBDH in the form of                                               
a 128-byte Did Data Block (DDB). The system is arranged so that as one DDB is being -                                             
output from one 128-byte section of memory, by DMA transfer, data received from                                                   
the subsystems are stored in a second 128-byte section. A continuous check is made                                                
on the DMA process so that when transfer of a DDB is complete, operations on the                                                  
two memory sections are interchanged and the process repeats. Afler each DDB byte                                                 
transfer, the memory location is cleared, so ensuring that the buffer is completely                                               
empty at the start of each DDB transfer. The time taken to transfer one DDB is defined                                            
as a DGI and it follows that the information contained in a DDB is that which was                                                 
collected in the previous DGI. The first two bytes in every DDB contain a 16-bit                                                  
counter which identifies a block in any period of continuous operation of the ex-                                                 
periment.                                                                                                                         
  The total number of telemetry words allocated to the DID experiment in Format 1                                                 
is 1024 words/format and in Format 2 2560 words/format. Hence there are 8 DDB                                                     
and 20 DDB in Formats 1 and 2, respectively.                                                                                      
  The DGI is also a function of spacecraft telemetry rate. The relationship between                                               
format, data rate, DDB and DGI is shown in Table 2.

  The scientific data are contained in a fixed format in the 128-byte DDB as follows:

 For the MSM and IPM-P (DID 1P) subsystems each event is categorized by testing                                                   
for internal and external co-incidence. The number of events in each DGI is totalled                                              
and the complete data set for the last example in each category is held in the DDB.                                               
For both subsystems, the categories are mutually exclusive and thus the total number                                              
of events processed in each DGI is the sum of the category event counters in the                                                  
corresponding DDB, provided that none of the counters have saturated. In the case                                                 
of the IPM-P subsystem, the data from the once-per-format calibration event are                                                   
retained and not overwritten by any category-6 or -7 events. The relevant event                                                   
counters are not affected.                                                                                                        
   IPM-P hardware accumulated data are collected from the subsystem at various times                                              
during a DGI. The counts for each accumulator are totalled at the end of the DGI and                                              
compressed into one 8-bit word per channel.                                                                                       
   DID 7 (CIS) counts are collected four times per DGI and are totalled before inser-                                             
tion into the DDB.                                                                                                                
   IPM-M (DID 1M) data are always collected in conjunction with IPM-P data, and                                                   
are dealt with in the same manner as those collected after an individual IPM-M flag                                               
request. There is no categorization, the magnitude binning and discrete data formatting                                           
being done in the same manner as for MSM.

sensor together with the timing word, which contains information of internal MSM                                                  
and MSM/C1S coincidence. Threshold levels are written back to the subsystem,                                                      
producing dead-times proportional to the event magnitude. These are followed by an                                                
acknowledge pulse to reactivate the subsystem.                                                                                    
  The event is then categorized and the appropriate category counter incremented.                                                 
There are five categories:

Category  5        Any other event not in categories 1 to 4.                                                                      
                                                                                                                                  
The discrete data for the event are put into the DDB in a position fixed by the category                                          
determined above. Data from events containing RSM data are, however, always                                                       
written into the category-3 slot. Any data previously written into the selected category                                          
slot during the DGI is automatically overwritten.                                                                                 
 Over the period of a DGI, the magnitude of outputs from sensors DID 2, 3 and 4                                                   
are compared for every MSM event. The highest value is held in byte 111 of the DDP.                                               
In order to indicate the source, the low 2 bits of the number are masked out and                                                  
replaced with a sensor identification code:

Finally, a counter corresponding to the signal magnitude is incremented. The handling                                             
of DID 2 and DID 3 values is dependent upon the MSM mode. In Mode 1, the DID                                                      
3 value is ignored and the DID 2 value is used, whereas in Mode 2 it is the DID 3                                                 
value which is taken. In modes 0 and 3, the values of the two signals are added and                                               
divided by 2; the resulting number is used as the event magnitude.                                                                
  DID 2 and DID 3 sensors can be operated in four hardware modes, for which there                                                 
are corresponding CDF program variations. These modes are:

At power-on, the experiment starts in Mode 0 Auto Sample. The mode can be changed                                                 
at any time by command; the new mode selected takes effect at the start of the format                                             
following receipt of the command by the CDF.                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                  
6.8 IPM-P discrete event data handling                                                                                            
  The IPM-P subsystem contains two sections which are accessed through the same                                                   
port. Data from individual events, signalled by Event flag 2, are read from the four                                              
addresses and acknowledged. Following an IPM-P read operation, the IPM-M sensor                                                   
data are collected, ensuring that any coincident information is gathered.                                                         
  In addition to the discrete outputs, there are 16 high-speed hardware counters, which                                           
are read 18 times per DGI. The timing for this operation is derived from the                                                      
Experiment/OBDH data transfer (see Section 6.1).                                                                                  
  The IPM-P subsystem digital electronics operates from 10 V rather than the 5 V level                                            
used for the CDF. Conversion from 5 to 10 V is achieved using V-MOS transistors                                                   
with resistive pull-ups. Conversion down to 5 V is achieved by simple 2:1 resistive                                               
dividers.                                                                                                                         
  The four sensor output bytes from the IPM-P discrete-event section contain six bits                                             
of magnitude information and two bits of coincidence calibration flags. If either of the                                          
calibration flags is set, the four data bytes are written into bytes 73-76 of the DDB,                                            
and no other processing is done. Otherwise the coincidence bits are tested, first for                                             
Categories 3, 5 or 7 (sensor B) and then for Categories 2,4 or 6 (sensor A). The overall                                          
arrangement is:

  6              Sensor A no coincidence data                                                                                     
  7              Sensor B no coincidence data                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                  
Except for the calibration data, the A and B sensors are treated separately. When the                                             
category of the event has been determined, the appropriate event/magnitude counter                                                
in the DDB is incremented and the data written into the correct event data slot. In the                                           
case of Category 6 or 7 events, a test is made to ensure that no calibration data are                                             
overwritten. As with the MSM, the data present in the event discrete data slots are                                               
those from the last event of that category to occur before the end of the DGI.                                                    
  A reset pulse is sent to the IPM-P subsystem to re-enable event detection.                                                      
  Over the period of one DGI, the 16 IPM-P hardware accumulator bytes are                                                         
transferred 18 times. After each read function, the data are added into 16 two-byte                                               
scratchpad registers, thus providing a maximum possible count of 262144. At the end                                               
of the DGI, the count contained in each register is compressed into an 8-bit word and                                             
put into the DDB. Counts less than 128 are uncompressed, but are shifted left once                                                
and the LSB is forced to zero. Numbers greater than 127 are shifted right until the                                               
most significant bit is in the bit-8 position. The bottom four bits are then masked out                                           
and replaced by a number indicating the number of right shifis. The LSB (bit 0) is                                                
forced to 1 to indicate that compression has occurred.

  The IPM-M subsystem shares the MSM port hardware. Two addresses are used.                                                       
After Event flag 3 has been detected, the IPM-M data output is read twice, the sub-                                               
system threshold is set, and the operation is acknowledged. The IPM-M is also read                                                
in conjunction with the IPM-P. The data present at the interface at the start of a read                                           
correspond to the signal level just prior to the event. This pre-event value is read and                                          
stored and another conversion is made by the IPM-M in order to determine the event                                                
value. The magnitude counter corresponding to the event is incremented and the event                                              
and pre-event data are put in the DDB.                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                  
6.10 CIS data handling                                                                                                            
  The CIS-CDF interface transfers one 8-bit word 4 times per DGI. The data transfer-

processing of these data are carried out.                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                  
6.11  Event-magnitude computation                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                  
  A single subroutine is used for all calculations of event magnitude and incrementing                                            
the appropriate counter. The subroutine is called with two parameters: counter address                                            
and start of look-up table. Separate look-up tables are provided for DID-2/3, DID-4,                                              
DID-5, IPM-M and IPM-P.                                                                                                           
  The first lookup-table value is subtracted from the input value being tested. If the                                            
result is negative, the first magnitude counter is incremented; if the result is positive,                                        
the look-up table and counter pointers are incremented and the process repeats until                                              
the result finally goes negative.                                                                                                 
  When incrementing the counters a check is made and the count stops at 255 to pre-                                               
vent roll-over.

The requirement for electrical isolation between subsystems and the need for many                                                 
different supply-voltage levels results in a DC-DC converter with 16 separate out-                                                
puts. The converter is a high-frequency-driven, two-phase device (Fig. 11).                                                       
  The internal oscillator runs free at approximately 122 kHz and drives a bi-stable

transistors, which in turn drive the converter transformer. For reasons of mass,                                                  
volume and efficiency no regulation is provided on the outputs: the limited input                                                 
voltage swing and relatively constant load ensure adequate performance.                                                           
  A synchronizing signal from the spacecraft feeds the input to the phase-locked loop                                             
system, thus locking the converter to the desired frequency.                                                                      
  For mass, volume and efficiency reasons, no regulation is provided on the outputs,

overall efficiency of the converter is 85%.

   Fifteen supply rail voltages and one internal temperature sensor are monitored. The                                            
voltages are conditioned to be between 0 and + 5 V and are multiplexed within the                                                 
experiment. Each value appears once per telemetry format.                                                                         
                                                                                                                                  
7.2 DID-1 cover release                                                                                                           
  The circuit of the DID-1 cover-release unit and driver is shown in Figure 12. The                                               
two HEXFET transistors in series form an efficient AC switch. Under normal condi-                                                 
tions, both transistors are turned off. Application of a 5 V pulse at the switch input                                            
triggers the latch formed by the cross-coupled gates, which turns on the HEXFET                                                   
switch, thus applying a 60 kHz, 4 V peak-peak square wave to the heater wire. The                                                 
250 mW dissipation is sufficient to melt the plastic retainer, thus releasing the cover.                                          
The circuit is reset after use by powering down the experiment.

  DIDSY was switched on for the first time in flight at 0418 UTC on 8 October 1985.                                               
All housekeeping channels indicated nominal operation. Calibration pulses in the IPM-                                             
P subsystem indicated correct operation of the IPM-P and CDF. All eight modes of                                                  
the MSM subsystem were commanded and verified. After some 50 h of operation, no                                                   
impacts have been detected, but none would have been expected in this period. Of                                                  
note, however, was that, coincident with the actuation of a pyrotechnic device to

signals) were detected in the IPM-P subsystem due to acoustic coupling or electrical                                              
interference.
