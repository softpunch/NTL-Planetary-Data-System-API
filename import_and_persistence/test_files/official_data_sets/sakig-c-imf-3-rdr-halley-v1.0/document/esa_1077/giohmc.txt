Abstract                                                                                                                          
  The Halley Multicolour Camera (HMC) is a Ritchey-Chretien type Cassegrain                                                       
telescope (1000 mm focal length) with CCD imagers in the focal plane. It is mounted                                               
on the experiment platform of the Giotto spacecraft and looks out via a 45deg turret mir-                                         
ror. It is suspended in a revolving mount so that the centre of its field of view can be                                          
moved freely in a half plane that contains the spin axis of the spacecraft. Together with                                         
the spinning motion of the spacecraft, this mobility enables the HMC to image any part                                            
of the whole 4 pi solid angle of the sky.                                                                                         
  The line-scan imaging technique uses the spacecraft's spin for one dimension and                                                
the length of the line for the other dimension of the image. Four line sensors with filters                                       
of different colour bands take images almost simultaneously. Onboard electronics con-                                             
trolled by three microprocessors operate the camera almost autonomously. The image                                                
of the comet will be searched for at the beginning of encounter operations. Having                                                
found it, the camera will switch to the imaging mode.                                                                             
  The contents of the images are to be telemetered to ground in sections and at the same                                          
time used onboard to update the parameters that describe the spacecraft's trajectory                                              
relative to the cometary nucleus. With this information, the HMC's field of view will                                             
be able to track the centre of the comet's image.                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                  
1 Introduction                                                                                                                    
  In recent decades, Whipple's 'dirty snowball' picture of the cometary nucleus has                                               
become widely, but not universally accepted. Proof of the nucleus' existence and study                                            
of its properties require pictures in various colour bands, preferably together with other                                        
information. Acquisition of these pictures is the task of Halley Multicolour Camera                                               
(HMC), which has been designed and built by an international collaboration of scien-                                              
tists and engineers.                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                  
2. Scientific Objectives                                                                                                          
  The aim of the HMC is to provide high-quality images of the comet's nucleus in four                                             
colours with two polarizations, and of the coma in several filter bands. The generally                                            
accepted Whipple model predicts an icy conglomerate nucleus composed of frozen                                                    
molecules mixed with dust. Because of the lack of resolution of ground-based in-                                                  
struments, a cometary nucleus has never been observed. Multicolour high-resolution                                                
imaging of the nucleus will contribute to the investigation of its:                                                               
-   size, shape, and volume                                                                                                       
-   surface properties (structure, morphology, and inhomogeneities due to possible ac-                                            
    tive regions)                                                                                                                 
-   photometric properties (albedo as a function of wavelength and phase angle, for                                               
    a better understanding of the chemical composition of the nucleus)                                                            
-   large-scale asymmetries in the sublimation process related to the rotation of the                                             
    nucleus, and the solar phase angle (thermal lag, jets, envelopes, etc.)                                                       
-   rotation period and spin-axis direction                                                                                       
-   mechanism of mass loss                                                                                                        
-   energy balance on the surface (insolation/sublimation).                                                                       
                                                                                                                                  
In addition to studying the cometary nucleus, multicolour imaging of the coma will                                                
permit investigation of:                                                                                                          
-   the production and evolution of gas molecules and dust grains                                                                 
-   the characteristic scale length of the interaction of the coma with the nucleus, the                                          
    acceleration of the dust by the gas, and the dust density distribution from the                                               
    nuclear surface outwards                                                                                                      
-   dust-grain size distribution and physical properties from scattering and albedo

-   chemistry of inner gas coma                                                                                                   
-   time-dependent properties of the dust-gas outflow (streamers)                                                                 
-   the possible presence of an icy grain halo.                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                  
Simultaneous observations from the Earth will permit stereo views and determinations                                              
of the three-dimensional geometry of the coma.                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                  
3. Overview                                                                                                                       
3.1 The Camera                                                                                                                    
  The scientific objectives are to be pursued with a 1000 cm focal length telescope.                                              
designed to operate on a spin-stabilized platform. The shortest exposure times for off-                                           
spin-axis observations near closest approach to the nucleus will be less than 20 micro s,                                         
determined by the pixel crossing time of the rapidly moving image in the focal plane,                                             
so that a mechanical shutter cannot be used. The field of view (FOV) of a telescope                                               
with high resolving power/magnification is necessarily quite small, and as the aspect                                             
angle of the cometary centre will change during the flyby from near 0deg to 180 deg the                                           
telescope has to be articulated so that its FOV can follow it.                                                                    
  The above considerations led to the basic design illustrated in Figures 1 to 5 (details                                         
to be described in the following sections). A line-scanning imaging technique is                                                  
employed whereby the spacecraft's rotation provides one spatial dimension and the                                                 
linear dimension of the line detector provides the orthogonal dimension. A set of five                                            
linescanning detectors - one for timing control and four for imaging in different                                                 
colours - is used to provide colour images of the comet. Figure 4 illustrates how a                                               
line-scan image of the target is taken at the proper angle and time, and Figure 5 shows                                           
the arrangement of the line detectors in the focal plane.                                                                         
 In order to be able to follow the target to large offset angles, the telescope is mounted                                        
with its optical axis perpendicular to the spin axis of the spacecraft, and its FOV is                                            
deflected by 90deg via a 45deg turret mirror. Rotating the telescope around its optical axis                                      
by 180deg changes the centre direction of the FOV from alignment with the spin axis (at                                           
the beginning of encounter operations) to the antiparallel direction. This rotational mo-                                         
tion, together with the spacecraft's spinning motion, allows the HMC to image a target

and X', Z', are HMC internal coordinate                                                                                           
systems. In the position shown Z' is (within                                                                                      
alignment errors) parallel to the +Z axis of the                                                                                  
Giotto spacecraft                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                  
anywhere within the complete 4 pi solid angle of the sky.  A possible small 'blind spot'                                          
near the spin axis due to misalignment is avoided by the possibility to tilt the deflecting                                       
mirror by about 1deg in either direction from the 45deg centre position. This tilt capability                                     
can also be used if the target should be found to be aligned exactly with the spin axis.                                          
In that event there will be no linear motion of the image, which is needed to employ                                              
the line-scanning technique; the scene will then be swept smoothly across the line                                                
detector by tilting the deflecting mirror, thereby introducing an artificial linear move-                                         
ment of the image ('on-axis-imaging' in HMC terminology).                                                                         
  Three of the four line detectors are covered by permanent colour filters, while the                                             
fourth (line C in Fig. 5) has an 11-position filter wheel in front of it (see Section 4).                                         
This filter wheel contains narrow and wideband filters and polarizers, so that the dust                                           
as well as the gas coma can be investigated, in addition to the cometary nucleus.                                                 
  The search for the cometary nucleus here will be conducted by looking for the                                                   
brightest spot in the FOV. This is the least model-dependent principle compared, for                                              
instance, with the search for a contrast pattern or even negative contrast (dark nucleus                                          
on light background). If the nucleus is visible at all, the dust cloud must be optically                                          
thin, and chances are then high that the surface of the nucleus will be the brightest part                                        
in the FOV. Should the reflectivities of the surface and the dust be so drastically dif-                                          
ferent that the dust is brighter than the surface of the nucleus, then in the optically thin                                      
case the brightest spot must still be very close to the nucleus, because the dust density                                         
is highest there.                                                                                                                 
  Only in the optically thick case, where the nucleus will be invisible anyway, is it like-                                       
ly that the brightest spot will be far from the nucleus, and it is then still likely that

the vicinity of the brightest spot will be the most interesting part of the whole scene.                                          
  The data rate allotted to the HMC is 20058 bit/s. At 8 bit/pixel, this is sufficient                                            
to transmit the content of an image section of 98X98 pixels, plus appropriate                                                     
housekeeping information, to ground during each 4s spin period. The picture format                                                
will be changed at times so that smaller and larger picture sections can be transmitted                                           
alternately or interleaved.                                                                                                       
  In order to transmit a maximum of information within the given data-rate con-                                                   
straints, the analogue signal data are compressed by taking the square root of the                                                
signal. In this way the digitization error or step width is proportional to the standard                                          
deviation of the fluctuation distribution, with the actual signal as the assumed mean                                             
value. Data compression is therefore naturally fitted to the inherent uncertainties of                                            
the data to be gathered.

  The HMC operates in four basic modes, called Acquisition, Coma, Nucleus and                                                     
Observatory Modes.                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                  
3.2.1 Acquisition                                                                                                                 
  At the beginning of encounter operations, the image of the comet has to be found                                                
and identified. A line detector 1.6deg wide in the focal plane of the HMC will be used                                            
for this purpose. By tilting the deflecting mirror and rotating the barrel (telescope)                                            
appropriately, a 4.4deg X 4.6deg field in front of the spacecraft centred on its nominal spin                                     
axis will be searched. The image of an object in front of the spacecraft will move in                                             
circles in the focal plane with the spin angular velocity. By sweeping the FOV across                                             
the line detector, the moving image must cross the detector, and the time and place                                               
of the detector crossing will be recorded. A sufficiently large search field has been                                             
chosen that the full circle of the worst-case misaligned cometary image will be                                                   
covered. After having recorded a sufficient number of crossings, the Digital Process-                                             
ing Unit (DPU) will calculate the parameters of the image's movement: spin and nuta-                                              
tion period, radius, and phase. It uses this information in the next operational mode                                             
(Coma) to take pictures around the brightest spot in the FOV at the proper time.                                                  
  At this time in the mission, the cometary nucleus is expected to be much smaller                                                
than a pixel of the line detector (30 micrometer X 375 micrometer, l micrometer is equivalent                                     
to 1 microradian). The signal on one of the large pixels is therefore expected to be                                              
dominated by the coma of the comet, because it will project an extended image into the focal                                      
plane. The algorithm will therefore search for an extended object in the scene.

spin-stabilized spacecraft                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                  
3.2.2 Coma Mode                                                                                                                   
  For most of the mission, the circle that the image describes in the focal plane will                                            
be so small that it is expected to cross only one line detector safely. For circle radii                                          
rho <0.8deg, the on-axis-imaging technique (see Section 3.1) will be used. The geometry                                           
for data acquisition has been chosen such that the cometary image crosses one detector                                            
line (line C, Fig. 5) at right angles. Only this detector line will be used for picture                                           
taking during Coma Mode.                                                                                                          
  There will be >= 3 h between completion of the acquisition and closest approach.                                                
During this period a large number of pictures will be taken in various formats and us-                                            
ing all of the filters. This will yield data on the innermost coma with varying FOV                                               
and resolution; the largest picture transmitted will be the full CCD area of 292 pixels                                           
(height) by 390 pixels (width).                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                  
3.2.3 Nucleus Mode                                                                                                                
  Depending on the final flyby distance, some 9 min or less before closest approach,                                  :           
the radius of the cometary image's track in the focal plane will exceed 1.6 deg. The circle                                       
will then be so large that all four imaging line detectors will be crossed by the image                                           
nearly perpendicularly. This is therefore the threshold for switching to Nucleus Mode.                                            
Image sections of 76 X 76 pixels from all four detectors will be transmitted to ground                                            
once during each spin period. The resolution on the surface of the nucleus will be bet-                                           
ter than 800 m per pixel from this distance.                                                                                      
 The line detectors have different filters in front of them (Fig. 5 and Table 1). Line                                            
B has a red filter, line C an orange or polarizing filter, line D a blue filter, and line                                         
E is the clear channel integrating over the whole spectrum (see spectral responsivity                                             
of the CCDs, Fig. 9). The clear channel will be read out at full resolution, the col-                                             
oured channels at half resolution, i.e. 38 X 38 pixels of double linear size each. With                                           
this information, a colour picture of 76 X 76 pixels of the highest obtainable resolution                                         
can be constructed just before loss of tracking or loss of the mission.                                                           
                                                                                                                                  
3.2.4 Observatory Mode                                                                                                            
  In order to take pictures anywhere in the sky at will, an operational mode has been                                             
included that permits imaging at arbitrary separation angles (i.e. telescope                                                      
rotation angles) and spin phases without the need for tracking (see below).

  As the Giotto spacecraft is now well on its way to Halley's Comet, the HMC system                                               
has already been tested in space and found to be working with only minor deviations                                               
from its expected behaviour.

4.1.1 Mission and instrument constraints                                                                                          
  The spacecraft for the Giotto mission was designed to be a spinning body, and the                                               
flyby geometry calls for the spin axis to be parallel to the spacecraft-comet relative                                            
velocity vector. The intended very close encounter with the comet immediately impos-                                              
ed a number of constraints on the basic camera design:                                                                            
(a) The cometary image is always moving (on circles); this would cause a smearing                                                 
    of the image if the exposure time were longer than that needed for a point image                                              
    to cross a basic resolution element (smearing time). The smearing time depends                                                
    on the separation angle rho between the spin vector and the direction towards the                                             
    target, and is obviously shortest for rho=90deg.                                                                              
(b) The separation angle rho changes during the mission. This necessitated some kind                                              
    of articulation for the FOV between small and large rho.                                                                      
(c) Dust will be encountered near the comet, so that the most sensitive parts of an                                               
    instrument had to be protected by the dust shield against high-velocity (69 km/s)                                             
    dust impacts                                                                                                                  
(d) CCDs were selected as image sensors, which need a cooled environment to                                                       
    avoid excessive dark-signal integration.                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                  
4.1.2 Basic design                                                                                                                
  To comply with the above constraints, the basic HMC design was developed as

dust shield. Viewing directions other than 90deg w.r.t. the spin axis are obtained by                                             
means of a rotating turret mirror. Cooling is achieved by radiating heat to space, and                                            
the short exposure times which would not be possible with mechanical shutters                                                     
(shortest smearing time for this particular design is 14.2 micro s) are achieved by line-scan                                     
imaging.                                                                                                                          
  Line-scan imaging leads to undistorted imaging only for a 90deg separation angle; at                                            
other angles the image is not only moving linearly in the focal plane of the telescope,                                           
but also rotating. This causes a particular distortion when scanning it by a line detec-                                          
tor, but the data can be deconvolved. The limiting case in which the target appears                                               
to be exactly on the spin axis would cause some deconvolution problems, because here                                              
the image only rotates and has no linear movement. In this case (for separation angles                                            
smaller than 0.8 deg) 'on-axis-imaging' will be achieved by tilting the deflecting mirror                                         
(see Section 3.1). A particular problem with a line-scan camera on a spinning platform                                            
is the potential 'blind spot' if the target is on the spin axis, and the spin axis and the                                        
optical axis (after deflection by the mirror) are not perfectly parallel; this problem is                                         
overcome when the image is moved artificially by tilting the mirror.                                                              
  The basic design of the HMC is illustrated by Figures 1 to 4. In Figure 1, which                                                
is a cross-sectional schematic of the camera, the optics of the telescope and the focal                                           
plane, as well as the detectors, are situated behind the dust shield. The 45deg deflecting                                        
turret mirror allows the FOV to be parallel to the spacecraft's spin axis (rho=0deg)                                              
The turret mirror allows the HMC to reach rho= 180deg (i.e. the position shown in Fig. 1)                                         
by rotation about the optical axis and this together with the spinning motion of the                                              
spacecraft, makes it possible to cover the whole sky.                                                                             
  With the turret-mirror design, the detector line has always to be parallel to the                                               
deflecting mirror plane, which implies that the detector line has to be turned in the                                             
same way as the turret mirror. As a result, the whole camera - telescope, focal-plane                                             
detectors, deflecting mirror and baffle - has been designed to rotate as a unit. The                                              
detectors need cooling and so it was decided to use the 'knee' that houses the deflecting                                         
mirror as a radiator, and to use the 'barrel' that houses the telescope as a heat conduc-                                         
tor between the Focal Plane Unit (FPU) and the radiator.                                                                          
  The mechanical connections between the moving camera and the experiment plat-                                                   
form (bearing, rotation drive mechanism and cabling) were all designed so as to                                                   
minimize heat conduction from the spacecraft into the camera. The original design                                                 
goal was to achieve -30degC in the FPU; the final construction yielded >=  -20degC,                                               
which the detectors can readily cope with.                                                                                        
  Figure 3 is a schematic of the telescope system and associated electronics.                                                     
  In order to help visualize the operation of the HMC, Figure 4 is an attempt to il-                                              
lustrate the taking of a picture. Because of the spinning motion of the spacecraft, the                                           
FOV of the HMC covers an annulus on the sky with radius rho during the course of                                                  
one spin period. If the target (comet) happens to be within this strip as seen from the                                           
spacecraft, proper triggering and timing allows the HMC to take image data of just                                                
that part of the strip that is centred on the comet.                                                                              
                                                                                                                                  
4.2 Structure and thermal system                                                                                                  
4.2.1 Mechanical design                                                                                                           
  As mentioned in the last section, the optical telescope, with FPU, deflecting mirror                                            
(except for its small tilt capability) and baffle, is a mechanically rigid unit. Two sup-                                         
port structures, each containing three bearings, and attached to the experiment plat-                                             
form, hold the barrel and allow it to rotate about its axis, which is also the optical axis                                       
of the telescope. Two additional bearings control the axial position of the barrel.                                               
  The cabling posed a particular problem. From the detectors, the filter wheel, the                                               
mirror motor and the position encoders, there are a total of ~ 100 connections between                                            
the rotating camera unit and the static part of the system, with all the mechanical and                                           
thermal constraints. The solution employed is shown in Figure 6. The wires are the                                                
thinnest allowed by ESA specifications, in order to keep the heat input to the rotating                                           
unit at 200 mW.                                                                                                                   
  In order to avoid the camera's rotation having any influence on the spacecraft's spin                                           
period, its nonsymmetric rotating parts (deflecting mirror plus drive and baffle) had                                             
to be balanced so that the moments of inertia w.r.t. two axes perpendicular to the                                                
rotating axis are equal, to better than 10**-5. This required two protrusions at 120deg to                                        
the baffle, which can be clearly seen in Figure 2.                                                                                
  During Giotto's Ariane-l launch the moving portion of the HMC had to be clamped                                                 
with two metal strings so that it could not rotate erratically. A pyroelectric cutter was                                         
used to release the HMC 39 days after launch.                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                  
Figure 6. Cabling between the fixed structure                                                                                     
and the rotating part of the HMC, viewing                                                                                         
towards the back of the telescope (FPU  =                                                                                         
Focal Plane Unit)                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                  
4.2.2 Thermal design                                                                                                              
 The thermal design called for a cooled telescope focal plane, which is achieved by                                               
radiating heat to space from a surface covered with second-surface-mirror material                                                
(alpha/epsilon ~0.3). The surface radiating to space is approximately 600 cm**2. The attached                                     
baffle is painted with white Astral PCBZ paint, and it is sufficiently cold for a negli-                                          
gible amount of heat to be conducted to the knee. The barrel is made from 0.8 mm                                                  
thick aluminium and conducts the heat from the focal plane to the radiator. The whole                                             
rotating unit is coupled conductively to the spacecraft only by the 8 titanium bearings,                                          
the worm gear drive and the wiring to the FPU. Radiative coupling to the spacecraft                                               
has been minimized by covering the barrel with multi-layer insulation. All aluminium                                              
parts have an iridite surface finish. Having thermally insulated the rotating unit, it is                                         
obviously of paramount importance to keep the latter's electrical power dissipation to                                            
a minimum. As a result, most of the detector circuitry - except for preamplifiers -                                               
is in the electronics box, well separated from the focal plane.                                                                   
  With this thermal design it is possible to cool the camera by passive means despite                                             
the fact that (because of the spinning spacecraft) the radiator is periodically exposed                                           
to sunlight.                                                                                                                      
  A 26-node thermal model of the HMC was developed to verify first estimates and                                                  
help in the design. This model clearly demonstrated the feasibility of our design. The                                            
FPU temperature is expected to vary between -38degC and -18degC during the mission,                                               
as the solar aspect angle varies. The predicted FPU temperature at encounter is                                                   
-25degC and it will rise during the 4 h of operation by  ~ 4degC, due to the electrical                                           
power dissipation.                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                  
4.3 Mechanisms                                                                                                                    
  As indicated earlier, the HMC has three separate moving subsystems: the telescope                                               
assembly as a whole, the deflecting mirror, and the filter wheel. Stepper motors are                                              
used to drive the different mechanisms and the overall operation of the HMC is based                                              
on counting the step drive pulses transmitted to the motors with the proper sign.                                                 
Angular position encoders (two potentiometers and one optical/digital) are used on all                                            
mechanisms for housekeeping information, so that the user can assess the performance                                              
of the mechanisms.                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                  
 4.3.1 Rotation drive                                                                                                             
  The rotation mechanism is a worm-gear drive with the wheel mounted directly on                                                  
the barrel and the worm pushed against it by a spring-loaded lever to prevent backlash.                                           
Power is transmitted from the stepper-motor assembly to the worm shaft via a toothed                                              
belt. To monitor the rotation movements of the barrel, a high-precision potentiometer                                             
strip encoder (read out by a 12-bit ADC) is included in the design. The resistive strip                                           
is bonded to the outer surface of the barrel, and the wiper, with associated electronics,                                         
is integrated into the foot structure.                                                                                            
  Each full step rotates the barrel by 1/100 deg, which is then the basic resolution of the                                       
rotation drive. A fixed drive frequency of 1000 full steps per second results in a cons-                                          
ant rotational speed of 10deg per second. This frequency was chosen to allow the HMC                                              
to follow the apparent cometary motion for flyby distances of 500 km and larger. For                                              
closer flybys, there is a point some time before closest approach at which the cometary                                           
image will be lost and only regained some time after flyby at rho>90deg, i.e. looking                                             
backwards w.r.t. the relative-velocity vector.                                                                                    
 A reference position indicator and safety end switches complete the rotation drive                                               
mechanism. The reference indicator is an LVDT with voltage zero detection; its mov-                                               
ing core is actuated by the rotating barrel. The resolution of this device is better than                                         
0.01deg, which is adequate. The safety end-of-range switches are Reed relays, which                                               
cause the electrical driver circuitry to reverse the polarity of the pulses fed to the motor                                      
windings; this action is not controlled by the Motor-Control Processor, but rather by                                             
the Reed switches only.                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                  
4.3.2 Deflecting mirror mechanism                                                                                                 
 The mirror drive consists of a stepper motor and a worm drive gear that drives a                                                 
high-precision cam made from a titanium alloy. A lever rigidly connected to the moun-                                             
ting flange of the mirror rides on the polished surface of this cam. The mirror in turn                                           
is suspended by two flexural pivots, their centre line being the tilting axis. As the cam                                         
turns, the lever follows its outer edge surface and thereby tilts the mirror slowly, the                                          
allowed tilt range being 2.2deg around the 45deg position w.r.t. the optical axis. Software                                       
limits watched over by the DPU ensure that the lever cannot slide across the steep part                                           
of the cam.                                                                                                                       
 Speeds of 11.2 and 5.6 mrad/s, selectable via software by the DPU, are available                                                 
corresponding to stepper-motor frequencies of 1000 Hz and 500 Hz, respectively.                                                   
One step has been chosen to correspond to a distance of 22.4 microradians (~= 4.8") in the                                        
focal plane of the telescope, which is the size of a pixel for the CCD image detectors                                            
used. This was done so that images can be obtained without smearing. The faster mir-                                              
ror speed is to be used for on-axis imaging, while the slow speed will be used for                                                
acquiring the target (comet) at the beginning of the encounter operations (Acquisition                                            
Mode). A zero-position reference indicator completes the design of this mechanism.                                                
It is an LVDT device similar to the one used in the barrel rotation mechanism.                                                    
 The angular-position encoder for housekeeping purposes is again a high-precision                                                 
conductive plastic potentiometer; its wiper is rigidly fixed to the rotating cam. The                                             
potentiometer is again read out by a 12-bit ADC.                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                  
4.3.3 Filter-wheel mechanism                                                                                                      
 The filter wheel, with its 12 positions, is moved via a spur gear drive by a stepper                                             
motor. Four steps are necessary to change from one filter position to the next. A four-                                           
channel optical encoder (holes in the filter wheel) reads the correct filter-wheel posi-                                          
tions, with a fifth channel (data valid) to indicate erroneous positions between filters.                                         
                                                                                                                                  
4.3.4 Motor drive circuitry                                                                                                       
 As motor currents are high and the stepper pulse shapes can cause a lot of ripple                                                
on the supply voltage, the HMC has been allotted two lines from the main power bus,                                               
one for the analogue and digital electronics and a separate one for the motors. The                                               
motor power line feeds the drive circuits for the motors directly. A filter and a current                                         
limiter on the motor line are used to keep inrush current and ripple feedback onto the                                            
main bus to acceptable levels. Coupling between the motor control electronics,                                                    
powered by the converter line, and the motor drive electronics is achieved with opto-                                             
couplers. Only one set of control and drive electronics is used, as only one motor is                                             
allowed to operate at any one time.                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                  
4.4 Optics and baffle                                                                                                             
 The optics consist of two pans, namely the telescope itself and the deflecting mirror.                                           
As we have to expect small dust particles to hit the deflecting mirror long before                                                
closest approach to the comet, it is necessary to avoid direct sunlight or that reflected                                         
from parts of the spacecraft striking the mirror. This would cause a significant stray-                                           
light background to the images and a baffle had therefore to be added.                                                            
                                                                                                                                  
4.4.1 Telescope                                                                                                                   
 The telescope is mounted as a unit to the backplate of the barrel (Fig. 1). It is a                                              
modified Ritchey-Chretien design with a correcting field lens and a focal length of                                               
1000 mm. The active diameter of the primary mirror is 166 mm, the maximum com-                                                    
patible wth the HMC's basic design and the spacecraft constraints. The nonspherical                                               
primary and secondary mirrors are 246 mm apart. The secondary mirror is supported                                                 
by a mu-metal tube and four struts and has no mechanical interface with the barrel                                                
(Fig. 1). The geometric focal ratio is F/6.25, and the effective ratio is F/7.7, taking                                           
into account the obscuration by the secondary mirror, the support struts and reflection                                           
losses at the lens. Taking into account all components, together with alignment errors                                            
and the diameter of the Airy disc, we arrived at an estimated width of about two pixels                                           
for a point-source image, which has essentially been confirmed since launch.                                                      
                                                                                                                                  
4.4.2 Deflecting mirror                                                                                                           
  As the 160 mm diameter telescope's entrance pupil is situated near the deflecting                                               
mirror, the latter has to be elliptical, with minimum dimensions of 160 X226 mm**2. A                                             
polygonical figure slightly larger than the minimum ellipse was therefore chosen. The                                             
conflicting needs of achieving a good optical figure and keeping the weight quite small                                           
(<=650 g) led to a highly unusual design. Starting from a solid slab of aluminium (alloy                                          
7075), material was removed by means of two series of mutually perpendicular holes                                                
drilled in parallel to and between the two flat faces of the slab. Structural analysis of                                         
this shape was carried out, including the simulation of particle bombardment (Angrilli                                            
et al., 1984). The final product has outside dimensions of 244X l90X 17.5 mm**3 and                                               
weighs only 658 g.                                                                                                                
  Particle bombardment studies were also carried out on a number of candidate                                                     
substrate materials, using explosive charges at the premises of Difesa e Spazio at Col-                                           
leferro in Rome, and dust particles at the linear accelerator of the University of Kent                                           
(Coradini et al., 1982; 1984). One result of these studies was that the usual technique                                           
of covering the aluminium surface with a hard layer of nickel-chromium (Kanigen)                                                  
could not be employed, as the bombardment tests showed that large pieces of Kanigen                                               
could be removed by a particle impact. The pure aluminium surface had therefore to                                                
be used, with only a thin protective layer of MgF2.                                                                               
  The final quality of the mirror surface was measured in the optical workshops of                                                
the European Southern Observatory, with the following results: at 632 nm, 100% of                                                 
the active surface has a planarity of better than Lambda/5, 94% of better than Lambda/6; 80% of                                   
the reflected energy is enclosed in a cone of 20 microradian diameter, closely matching the                                       
pixel size of the detector.                                                                                                       
  The reflectivity was measured at both normal and 45deg incidence in the spectral range                                          
from 300 to 1000 nm; the results are shown in Figure 7 for both polarization states.

4.4.3 Baffle                                                                                                                      
  The entire baffle system was designed using adapted versions of both the APART                                                  
and GUERAP software programs, the latter kindly being made available by                                                           
ESA/ESTEC. Details of this design have been reported by Brunello (1983).                                                          
  The external cylinder is made from kevlar fibre and the attenuating rings from                                                  
aluminium. The internal finish is ASTRAL/S2 paint, and the flight model is coated                                                 
externally with a conductive white paint. The attenuation of the cylinder, whose main                                             
limitation is the unfavourable length-to-width ratio as dictated by spacecraft con-                                               
straints, exceeds the specifications (Fig. 8).                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                  
4.5 Focal-Plane Unit                                                                                                              
  The Focal-Plane Unit (FPU) is made up of the image detectors and associated op-                                                 
tical, mechanical and electronic support components, and the filter-wheel assembly.                                               
The filter-wheel mechanism has been described in Section 4.3; a description of the                                                
filters and their arrangement is more appropriately included here.                                                                
                                                                                                                                  
4.5.1 The detectors and their readout principle                                                                                   
  Two types of photon detectors are used in the HMC: CCD imagers and a double-line                                                
photodiode array (reticon). The tasks of the two different detector types and their                                               
readout principles are quite different.                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                  
4.5.1.1 CCD detectors                                                                                                             
  The CCDs are virtual phase devices made by Texas Instruments Inc. for portable                                                  
television cameras. Our special devices were made without the normal anti-blooming                                                
drain in the image section. The total sensitive area is organized in 584 lines, made up                                           
of 390 pixels, each 22.35 micrometer square.                                                                                      
  The operating principle is as follows. An area detector is covered with an opaque                                               
mask containing a window that leaves a few lines of pixels uncovered. The slit is                                                 
located near the 'top' of the area, i.e. the edge parallel to but furthest from the readout                                       
register. If an image moves perpendicularly across the slit, the CCD is clocked syn-                                              
chronously, which means that the charge packets are physically moved at the same                                                  
average speed as the image. The charge pattern under the mask is representative of                                                
the image simultaneously displayed on the top surface of the mask. It is essentially                                              
the principle of a slit-shutter camera, the difference being that here the image and the                                          
'detector' (charge pattern) are moving in synchronism while the slit is stationary w.r.t.                                         
the optics; in the slit shutter camera, the slit moves across the detector plane while                                            
it is illuminated by a 'still' picture.                                                                                           
  Electronically speaking, the masked area CCD is a line detector with an analogue                                                
storage area attached to it. Once clocking has been stopped, other parts of the image                                             
may move across the slit without contaminating the part of the picture under the mask.

baffle as a function of incident-light-beam                                                                                       
angle theta. A  = transmitted stray light/incident                                                                                
light                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                  
The reason for using this intermediate data storage is that lower noise readout is possi-                                         
ble at slower than real-time readout rates. Real-time readout in our case would require                                           
a maximum of 2.7 X 10**7 pixels per second. By contrast, in the system flown the total                                            
area is read out in 3.2 s, leaving some time for overhead within the 4 s spin period.                                             
The data rate is 73 pixels/s (or 13.75 micro s per pixel), allowing low-noise readout and                                         
easier data handling even with a 12-bit ADC. On the other hand, the long residence                                                
time of the pixel charges allows dark current to accumulate and therefore the device                                              
has to be cooled mildly, in our case to less than -20 deg C.                                                                      
  An additional advantage of using masked-area detectors as line detectors is the                                                 
potential use of a TDI (Time Delay and Integrate) technique for fine tuning or optimiz-                                           
ing exposure times. If several lines of pixels are exposed under a slit, and the image                                            
and the charge pattern move on average in synchronism along the columns, then the                                                 
smearing time is governed by the individual pixel height (because of the incremental                                              
movement of the charge packets), but the exposure time is governed by the total height                                            
of the exposed column of pixels and therefore can be longer than the smearing time.                                               
If lateral movements of the image are included, however, as in our case of the rotating                                           
image for rho << 90deg, then another smearing time across the columns has to be taken into                                        
account.                                                                                                                          
  In the actual flight detectors, two groups of 292 lines each can be clocked in-                                                 
dependently and both read out through the same readout register. In television applica-                                           
tions, the upper area is used for imaging, and the lower area for intermediate analogue                                           
data storage and readout whilst the next picture is being integrated in the upper area.                                           
Our specially fabricated detectors have a uniform layout and gate structure so that both                                          
areas can be used for line imaging and storage in the same way. The only difference                                               
between the two areas is that the image stored in the upper one has to wait at rest until                                         
the lower one has been read out. Only then is the upper charge pattern shifted into                                               
the lower section before read out. The upper area will therefore accumulate somewhat                                              
more dark signal than the lower one.                                                                                              
  The virtual phase CCDs have the advantage that the thermal dark charge generation                                               
rate is greatly reduced - as much as an order of magnitude compared with conven-                                                  
tional multiphase devices - so that testing with several seconds of integration/readout                                           
time can conveniently be conducted at room temperature.  As a side effect, however,                                               
another type of dark signal that has been termed 'spurious charge' is generated which                                             
depends on clocking amplitudes and wave forms rather than integration time. In addi-                                              
tion, noise in these devices is somewhat larger than in other CCD devices, because                                                
the output amplifier has been optimized for high gain and speed (for easy TV applica-                                             
tions) rather than for low noise.                                                                                                 
  Figure 9 shows the spectral response of the virtual-phase CCD. A special                                                        
characteristic of this device is that its gate structure covers only half of each pixel,                                          
the other half being covered by a 0.1 micrometer SiO2 protective layer only. Therefore, in                                        
contrast to other CCDs, some sensitivity at Lambda<400 nm is preserved. The multiple                                              
peak structure in the response is caused by interference in the uniformly very thin gate                                          
structure.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                  
4.5.1.2 Line detector diode array                                                                                                 
 An additional line detector placed in 'front' of the CCDs, in the sense of the moving                                            
image in the focal plane, performs two functions: it will be used for finding the com-                                            
etary image at the beginning of encounter operations, and for timing the picture-taking                                           
correctly even in the presence of spacecraft attitude disturbances near the cometary                                              
nucleus. In both cases near-real-time readout and fast data processing will be required.                                          
This detector line has to be longer than the CCD lines, and as high a sensitivity as                                              
possible is required.                                                                                                             
  The detector chosen is a CP 1001 reticon diode array, which consists of two rows                                                
each of 936 pixels, without dead area between. The pixel size along the row is 30 micrometers,                                    
and the pixel height across the row is 375 micrometers. The total sensitive area is therefore

28.08 mm X 0.75 mm. The double row was chosen to guard against the cometary                                                       
coma being rather faint at the beginning of encounter operations. This needs a large                                              
detector, which in turn will be hit frequently by cosmic rays, causing spurious events.                                           
  As the image of a celestial object moves across the double line, it will cause a response                                       
of at least two opposite pixels, one in each row. Almost point-like cosmic-ray events,                                            
however, can cause coincident signals in opposite pixels only if they impact very close                                           
to the dividing borderline, and therefore the requirement of coincident signals keeps                                             
the sensitive area for cosmic-ray-induced events small while offering the full height                                             
of the pixels for a moving image.                                                                                                 
  The detector can be read out in either of two modes, 'slow' or 'fast'. The need to                                              
drive this detector at vastly different pixel readout rates caused some headaches. Nor-                                           
mally, the fixed pattern of offsets can be minimized by lowering the clock amplitude.                                             
However, since safe fast (MHz) operation can only be achieved with high amplitudes                                                
( >= 11 V), this feature could not be used to our advantage. Fortunately, it turned out                                           
(for our method of clocking and driving the clock lines) that a relative minimum in fixed-                                        
pattern amplitude could be achieved for both clocking speeds at the same clock                                                    
amplitude. With onboard fixed-pattern determination and subtraction, this finally did                                             
not cause a major problem.                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                  
4.5.2 Mechanical arrangement                                                                                                      
4.5.2.1 Detector arrangement - virtual focal plane                                                                                
  As has been pointed out, the image data are gathered by a line-scanning technique.                                              
In order to obtain several colours almost simultaneously for pictures, four CCD                                                   
detector lines with different colour filters superposed are placed in parallel in the focal                                       
plane so that the image crosses all four of them in succession. The path of the image                                             
in the focal plane will generally be a circular arc due to the spinning motion of the                                             
spacecraft, the radius being the tangent of the separation angle rho. The virtual focal                                           
plane is illustrated in Figure 5.                                                                                                 
  If rho is sufficiently large, all four detector lines are crossed and, once the data have                                       
been properly deconvolved and matched, a colour picture can be constructed. As there                                              
is some uncertainty in the movement of the image due to spacecraft nutation and, in                                               
the late phase of the encounter, dust impacts on the spacecraft, another wider line                                               
detector has been added in front of the four colour lines so that the image crosses the                                           
wide detector first. Very fast readout and real-time analysis of this detector's signals                                          
will be used for 'triggering' the instrument. Rho and the spin period define the speed of                                         
the image, and when the image's crossing has been recognized by the wide line, the                                                
timing of the data acquisition of the colour lines is adjusted so that image data around                                          
the centroid of brightness are gathered and stored for subsequent transmission to the                                             
ground station. The width perpendicular to the direction of motion of the image of the                                            
triggering detector is larger than for the other detector lines, so that triggering will                                          
not be lost if the cometary image 'jumps' occasionally due to dust impacts. In addition,                                          
the wide line will be used during the 'Acquisition' phase of encounter operations to                                              
search for the cometary image in a 4.4deg X 4.6deg field, and compute the parameters of                                           
its movement in the focal plane. Thereafter, data acquisition can be placed accurately                                            
in space and time centred on the cometary image.                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                  
4.5.2.2 Detector arrangement - actual focal plane                                                                                 
  As the housing of a detector (CCD and diode array) usually takes up significantly                                               
more space than the detector chip itself, it proved impossible to get two CCDs and                                                
the line array sufficiently close together to make an image plane of practical size                                               
without a special CCD development programme. Two plane mirrors were therefore                                                     
introduced in front of the focus so that the two CCDs could be physically well                                                    
separated, with their sensitive lines nevertheless close together in the virtual focal                                            
plane. A schematic cross-section through the FPU (Fig. 10) shows the arrangement                                                  
of the individual detectors and the filter wheel, and how a converging beam of a mov-                                             
ing star-like image successively crosses detector lines A to E.                                                                   
                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                  
4.5.2.3 Filters                                                                                                                   
  The CCDs are covered by different filters, as already mentioned. Care has been                                                  
taken to compensate for the different filter-glass refractive indices and light                                                   
wavelengths by choosing the thicknesses such that the focus through all filters lies on                                           
the CCD surface, and the heights of the windows in the CCD masks differ in order

which can be changed from one spin period to the next. These filters are intended                                                 
mainly for the observation of gas and dust in the cometary coma when the spacecraft                                               
is still far from the nucleus. All available filters, fixed and exchangeable, are listed

FPU housing is electrically insulated from the structure and the telescope barrel, and                                            
connected to the signal ground of the most interference sensitive detector, the diode

tronics box. This has resulted in acceptable performance for all detectors. The detector                                          
electronics have been described elsewhere (Kramm & Keller, 1985; Meyer et al.,                                                    
1985) and a short description should therefore suffice here.                                                                      
                                                                                                                                  
4.5.3.1 CCD electronics                                                                                                           
  The CCDs are read out by Correlated Double Sampling (CDS), a method widely                                                      
used for low-noise readout, and the signals are digitized in a 12-bit ADC. In order                                               
to improve on dynamic range, a factor 4 gain switch has been included, so that the                                                
total dynamic range is equivalent to a 14-bit word length. Each step in the low-gain                                              
range contains 150 electrons, so that the full range of signals (up to 5 X 10**5 elec-                                            
trons full well capacity of the CCDs) is covered. The clamping time of the CDS cir-                                               
cuitry is 1.25 micro s, and the clamp-to-sample time is 3.25 micro s. The total cycle time per                                    
pixel is 13.75 micro s, and as both CCDs are read out in parallel (staggered so that a digitiz-                                   
ed signal is transferred to the DPU every ~ 7 micro s), the total readout time for twice 584                                      
lines each with 390 pixels is 3.2 s. If only half of a CCD is read out, or 'super pixel'                                          
readout is used (one of which is generally the case), this total time is even shorter                                             
leaving sufficient time for calculations and repositioning of the telescope within one                                            
spin period of the spacecraft.  The term 'super pixel' applies when charge packets of                                             
several pixels are summed physically on the charge sensing node of the output gate                                                
of the CCD, thereby effectively increasing the size of the resolution element on the                                              
CCD. As signal noise is dominated by the noise of the first stage of the output                                                   
amplifier, the super-pixel readout results in higher sensitivity (and at the same time                                            
a larger field of view) at the expense of spatial resolution. Readout noise levels of 25                                          
electrons equivalent r.m.s. on the laboratory bench and 75 electrons equivalent r.m.s.                                            
within the full working HMC electronics system have been achieved. The latter value                                               
was confirmed during post-launch spacecraft operations but there appears to be some                                               
interference from other experiments on board Giotto.                                                                              
  The clocking of the CCDs has to be rather versatile. The typical sequence of clock-                                             
ing during one spin period consists of: (a) dumping of dark or other parasite charges,                                            
(b) acquisition of data, and (c) readout.                                                                                         
(a) The charge dumping is achieved by clocking the lines at 13.75 micro s per line and                                            
    the serial readout register at 0.625 micro s per pixel, the highest available clocking                                        
    frequency. Square waves with somewhat 'softened' edges between about -17 V                                                    
    and +1 V are used.                                                                                                            
(b) Data-taking speed has to be synchronized with the speed at which the image                                                    
    crosses the window in the mask. Periods of 1 ms per line (for 'on-axis-                                                       
    imaging'), and 14.23 micro s per line when the comet's aspect angle is 90deg, have to                                         
    be accommodated. This clocking is done by 'tri-level-clocking' , in which the                                                 
    positive- (+1 V) and negative-going parts (-17 V) of a bipolar pulse for shift-                                               
    ing the charge packets are about 7 micro s each, and in the variable interval between                                         
    two successive bipolar pulses the 'mid level' of approximately -6 V is main-                                                  
    tained. With this type of clocking, the virtual-phase CCD generates increased                                                 
    dark current (like other 'regular' CCDs), but little spurious charge, provided the                                            
    interval between the negative-going pulse followed by the positive-going pulse                                                
    is 50 micro s or longer. For shorter intervals, increased spurious charge cannot be                                           
    avoided.                                                                                                                      
(c) During readout, the potential of the gates in the imaging area is held negative                                               
    during most of the period in which the serial register is being read out. During                                              
    this 5.4 ms, the rate of dark charge generation is low. About 50 micro s prior to the                                         
    next shifting of a line of charge packets into the serial register, the gate voltage                                          
    is raised to the mid level of -6 V, followed by a 7 micro s positive pulse, the trailing                                      
    edge of which goes to the negative level of -17 V again. During the 50 micro s at                                             
    mid-level the dark charge generation is normal, which is not a problem due to                                                 
    the low duty cycle. The spurious-charge generation during line shifting is held                                               
    to a minimum because the time between negative and positive levels is sufficient-                                             
    ly long. With this type of 'mixed mode' clocking, the spurious-charge genera-                                                 
    tion during readout is restricted to less than 500 electrons per pixel, while with                                            
    bi-level clocking (without the 50 micro s mid level pedestal) the same devices                                                
    generate up to 10**4 electrons of spurious charge, per pixel.                                                                 
                                                                                                                                  
4.5.3.2 Diode-array electronics                                                                                                   
  The two lines of the diode array are each connected to two video lines. During comet                                            
acquisition, the whole array will be used, and the readout order is cyclical w.r.t. all                                           
four video lines (slow readout). During nucleus imaging, only one array is to be used                                             
(fast readout). A particular complication is that the analogue circuitry's frequency                                              
response had to be sufficiently wide to accommodate the two switchable frequencies                                                
of about 10.9 k pixels/s and 2 M pixels/s (both per video line). This has been achieved                                           
by actually switching the preamplifier bandwidth, and using two separate signal chains                                            
thereafter.                                                                                                                       
  Slow readout is the high-sensitivity, low-noise readout mode. All four video lines                                              
are read out cyclically, each with a 92 micro s repetition period. The video line is connected                                    
to the virtual ground input of the preamplifier. There the charge pulse is converted                                              
to a voltage pulse, decaying with a time constant of about 20 micro s via a 39 Mohm feedback                                      
resistor and its associated parasitic capacitance. Any influence of a not fully decayed                                           
pulse on the next one is removed by Correlated Double Sampling (CDS). The CDS                                                     
integrator takes a dark sample just prior to the arrival of a pulse and stores it in a                                            
capacitor on one input of an operational amplifier; thereafter, part of the pulse is in-                                          
tegrated on the other input of the operational amplifier. The output of the integrator                                            
is fed via a four-channel analogue multiplexer into a 12-bit ADC. The 'fixed pattern'                                             
of offsets inherent in the diode array's operation is subtracted after digitization in the                                        
DPU. The offset pattern is recorded onboard just prior to any operation of the HMC,                                               
so that long-term changes do not play a role.                                                                                     
 Noise levels of 1300 electrons equivalent r.m.s. on the laboratory bench and 3000                                                
electrons r.m.s. within the fully operating HMC system have been achieved. The noise                                              
on the bench was dominated by the particular switchable fast pulse preamplifier that                                              
we have to use. A quick check with a slow, low-noise preamplifier in its place showed                                             
that the system is capable of as low as 600 electron equivalent r.m.s.                                                            
 Fast readout is used during Nucleus Mode. The object is to read out the array so                                                 
fast that its output can be assessed before the part of the image that is being evaluated                                         
has reached the end of the uppermost CCD area, which is the storage area of line B.                                               
This time interval can be as short as 6 ms.                                                                                       
 To speed up the readout, only one of the two lines is used, the other one being                                                  
available for backup on command. Furthermore, pixels are grouped in pairs by summ-                                                
ing the signals of the two video lines for simultaneous readout. This results in 468                                              
double pixels per single array, which is read out at 2 M pixels/s. For this fast opera-                                           
tion, the bandwidth of the preamplifier on each video line has been increased by shunt-                                           
ing the 39 Mohm feedback resistor by a network of 1.5 kohm and 4.7 pF in parallel. The                                            
charge pulses on the video lines are thus converted into fast voltage pulses, summed                                              
in pairs, further amplified and fed to a 7-bit flash ADC with a response time of a few                                            
nanoseconds (made from two 6-bit interated-circuit flash type AD 3000 ADCs from                                                   
RCA). Fixed-pattern offset correction is again effected by the DPU, after having                                                  
recorded the pattern just prior to any operation.  Noise levels less than 15000 electrons                                         
equivalent r.m.s. within the fully operational HMC system are achieved in this way.

 The Digital Processing Unit (DPU) can be divided into four 'levels':                                                             
(i)  interface to sensor electronics                                                                                              
(ii) the fast-event-driven preprocessing of sensor data by special hardware pro-                                                  
     cessors, which are supported by one of the microprocessors (signal processor)                                                
(iii) two universal microprocessors (Experiment Control Processor and Motor Con-

     -  evaluation and formatting of measured data                                                                                
     -  servicing of Spacecraft interfaces                                                                                        
     -  servicing of status and command interfaces to sensor electronics and drives                                               
(iv)  the interfaces to the Spacecraft.                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                  
The requirements of levels (ii) and (iii) differ basically in their response time to critical                                     
requests (microseconds as opposed to milliseconds).                                                                               
 Figure 11 shows the structure of the DPU. In level (ii), the sensor data first pass                                              
the preprocessors (PP) to reduce the data rate for subsequent processing by the signal                                            
processor (SP). Special features of the SP are the support of the NSC 800                                                         
microprocessor by a hardware multiply/divide unit and the special interrupt service                                               
routines with their five hierarchical levels.                                                                                     
 In parallel with the extraction of some specific parameters from the sensor data in                                              
the block acquisition preprocessor (ACQ PP), tracking preprocessor (TRACK PP) and                                                 
signal processor (SP), the original CCD data are stored in their entirety in the mass                                             
memory after word-length shortening by a square-root function (SQR COMP, basic-

half of the telemetry buffer. The size and allocation of this small image (max. 16 k                                              
pixels) can be selected by the SP.                                                                                                
 The level (iii) tasks are assigned to two NSC 800 microprocessor systems. The Ex-

 4.6.1 Acquisition Preprocessor

detector. Each extended object produces a stripe of bright pixels. The ACQ PP                                                     
generates five characteristics parameters for each hit:                                                                           
 -   the address of the last pixel                                                                                                
 -   the stripe length in pixels                                                                                                  
 -   the number of the line in that scan (= mirror position)                                                                      
 -   the number of the scan                                                                                                       
 -   the hit time.                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                  
The task of the 'Fixed Pattern Correction', 'Threshold' and 'Single Spot Rejection'                                               
blocks is to clean the real diode-array signal of noise and offsets and to compress it                                            
into single-bit information (dark/bright). The resulting hit is only accepted for further                                         
calculations if its extent is at least 2 pixels in the horizontal and vertical directions.                                        
  The 'CCD Trigger Delay' is used to stop the clocking of the CCD a well-defined                                                  
time after the comet's image has crossed the diode array (used in Nucleus and Obser-                                              
vatory Modes). This delay time depends on the transit speed of the cometary image.                                                
  The Acquisition Preprocessor reduces the data rate from l pixel per 23 micro s to about 1                                       
byte per 2 ms, because the readout of hits is limited to five hits per line, equal to                                             
25 bytes per 50 ms. The data rate is therefore reduced by a factor of about 100.

for diode array data (Acquisition Unit)

for imager data (Tracking Unit)                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                  
4.6.2 Tracking Preprocessor                                                                                                       
  The task of the Tracking Preprocessor (Fig. 13) is to determine the intensity centre                                            
of the CCD image. This point is the input variable to the tracking program and also                                               
the centre of the small image section that is transmitted to ground. The telemetry rate                                           
of 20 kbit/s = 10 kbyte/spin allows transmission of only 98 X 98 pixels.                                                          
  To determine the brightest area of the picture, the full image is divided into 24 X 20                                          
elements ('bins') of 16 X 14 pixels each, and the intensity of these 224 pixels is                                                
accumulated for each bin. The sum is stored in the 'Bin Intensity RAM'. The SP                                                    
searches for the brightest bin in this memory and requests the ECP to transfer an image                                           
area of 32 X 28 pixels around this central element from the mass memory to the SPU.                                               
This area is used to calculate the centroid of brightness. Its coordinates and the hit time                                       
constitute input parameters for the tracking program.                                                                             
  The three anterior blocks are intended for the correction of defective columns of the                                           
CCD, by replacing them by their respective adjacent column, as well as the noise sup-                                             
pression. At the time of writing, no badly defective columns requiring this correction                                            
have been found.                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                  
4.6.3 Mass Memory                                                                                                                 
  The Mass Memory is able to store a full four colour image of the four CCD sections.                                             
After compression of the CCD data into 1 byte, there is a net capacity of                                                         
4 X 391 X 292 X 8 = 3.65 Mbit necessary, which increases to a total of about 6 Mbit                                               
due to the use of Hamming correction. This has been implemented by using 96 X 64 k                                                
DMOS devices. The minimum cycle time is 4 micro s, which is associated with a maximum                                             
power dissipation of 4.6 W. This relatively low consumption can be achieved by                                                    
'power strobing' of the peripheral electronics.

 Figure 14 shows the SPU software's structure. All routines that communicate direct-                                              
ly with the hardware are included in the 'operating software' block.                                                              
                                                                                                                                  
  The hardware-oriented 'operating software' surrounds the software kernel that                                                   
contains the mathematical algorithms for calculating the acquisition and tracking                                                 
parameters like a shell. These programs are exclusively software interfaced to the                                                
outer shell and could be written and tested without knowledge of the hardware. The                                                
'acquisition' and 'tracking' programs, which are activated in sequence, contain a set                                             
of common subroutines for floating-point operations, coordinate transformations,                                                  
averaging, trigonometrical functions, their inverse functions, etc.                                                               
 The program request service is controlled by the 'interrupt service routine', whilst                                             
the 'abbreviated functional test' program automatically checks the hardware function                                              
after switch-on. The result is transmitted to ground via telemetry. This test provides                                            
quick information about the status of the instrument.

Equipment                                                                                                                         
  The role of the ground-support equipment was to simulate the various subsystems                                                 
and the HMC as a whole as an aid in their development. Part of the Electrical Ground-                                             
Support Equipment (EGSE) has also been used at the European Space Operations Cen-                                                 
tre (ESOC) in Darmstadt for quick-look and preliminary-data-evaluation purposes.                                                  
                                                                                                                                  
5.1 Electrical Ground-Support Equipment                                                                                           
  The various functions of the EGSE during the development of the HMC are shown                                                   
schematically in Figure 15:                                                                                                       
(a)  First of all, the EGSE provided correct spacecraft interface simulation to the                                               
     Digital Processing Unit (DPU).                                                                                               
(b)  Wherever the HMC had to be operated without the help of the DPU, the EGSE                                                    
     provided a correct simulation of the interface between the sensor electronics and                                            
     the DPU, so that the HMC could be actuated, and data could be retrieved for                                                  
     evaluation.                                                                                                                  
(c)  To test the DPU in the absence of individual detector or analogue electronics                                                
     idiosyncrasies, the EGSE provided a simulated sensor electronics interface.                                                  
     Here the EGSE calculated 'images' of the comet, simulating their apparent                                                    
     movement during a complete encounter scenario so that both the DPU functions                                                 
     and the acquisition and tracking algorithms could be tested.                                                                 
(d)  The EGSE was also used as a spacecraft simulator and quick-look facility for                                                 
     testing the whole system realistically with the opto-mechanical ground support                                               
     equipment, which simulated an encounter scenario by projecting optical images                                                
     into the HMC.                                                                                                                
(e)  The EGSE is still being used as a quick-look instrument during flight.                                                       
                                                                                                                                  
  The EGSE hardware consists of two computers, each with specific characteristics                                                 
which determined its choice. The central or host computer is an LSI 11/23 mini                                                    
computer with hard-disk and tape storage and various peripheral interfaces. It pro-

ibility. It has been used to develop software, execute test routines, store data, manage                                          
the operation of the EGSE and communicate with the spacecraft checkout equipment.

The software is written in Pascal and all programs requiring user modification during

routines and calculation of spacecraft motion and images for the dynamic simulation,                                              
are resident in this computer. Uncorrected quick-look image display and the genera-                                               
tion of synthetic images for simulation are provided by this computer. Communication                                              
between the host computer and the variety of asynchronous 'real-time' camera inter-                                               
faces is performed by the interface computer, which is connected to the host by means                                             
of a bi-directional Direct Memory Access (DMA).                                                                                   
  The interface computer contains all of the 'real-time' interfaces, which closely                                                
simulate the electrical characteristics of the spacecraft, as seen by the HMC, such as                                            
voltages, impedances, timing and logic. It also provides preprocessing of telemetry                                               
data before transmission to the host for subsequent display and storage. All interfaces                                           
are serviced by the MC 68000 microprocessor-based interface computer under the                                                    
control of the host machine (Fig. 16).                                                                                            
  Dynamic closed-loop simulation is provided by combining motion control output                                                   
from the HMC microprocessors in the form of demanded telescope rotation and mirror                                                
tilt angles with simulated spacecraft body motion to generate the focal-plane dynamics

ages of several hundred thousand pixels of motion-corrected images for a single 4 s                                               
revolution of the spacecraft limited the practical simulation to small-area comet shapes                                          
with a constant background. Even so, the large amount of computation necessary for                                                
the geometrical distortion, motion and image generation, permits only quasi-real-time                                             
dynamic simulation. This is achieved with the use of halt states for the flight computer,                                         
while the EGSE calculates new images. Simulation is controlled by the host computer,                                              
which calculates the relative trajectory of the comet, the spacecraft body motion and                                             
the attitude of the Sun. Considerable effort was expended on the acceleration of                                                  
simulation and reduction of halt time, by simplification of the motion algorithm and                                              
elimination of redundant image generation. This has resulted in a run-time factor of                                              
approximately 4 X real time for the most complex Nucleus-Mode simulation.                                                         
  The development of the HMC EGSE has served to demonstrate the feasibility of                                                    
quasi-real-time closed-loop dynamic simulation of complex image-input systems by

5.2 Opto-Mechanical Ground Support Equipment                                                                                      
  An opto-mechanical simulator facility was built at the IAL in Liege, Belgium to                                                 
simulate the encounter scenario by actually projecting a moving cometary image into

spin phase) were simulated by using a turntable and articulated mirror. Large aspect                                              
angles were achieved by having the HMC itself mounted on a turntable, so that large                                               
camera rotational movements were compensated by counter-rotating the turntable.                                                   
The whole simulator was set up in a vacuum chamber, and a liquid-nitrogen-cooled                                                  
heat-sink plate was installed opposite the radiator plate of the HMC for realistic
