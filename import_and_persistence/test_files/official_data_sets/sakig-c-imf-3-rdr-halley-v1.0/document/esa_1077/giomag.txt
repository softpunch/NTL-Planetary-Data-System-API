The main objective of the Giotto Magnetometer Experiment is the investigation of                                                  
the interaction between Comet Halley and the solar wind at a distance of 0.9 AU from                                              
the Sun, to within 500 km of the cometary nucleus. A second objective is the study                                                
of the interplanetary magnetic field.                                                                                             
  The instrumentation consists of a triaxial and a separate biaxial system of fluxgate                                            
sensors of the ring-core type, the associated analogue electronics and a digital pro-                                             
cessor. The measuring ranges of +/- 16 nT, +/- 64 nT, etc., up to +/- 65536 nT are digitiz-                                       
ed by a 12-bit analogue-to-digital converter, allowing a sampling rate of 28.24 vectors                                           
per second at encounter. Memory modes allow the bridging of gaps in telemetry                                                     
coverage of up to ten days. The total mass of the instrument is 1360 g and its power                                              
consumption 820 mW.                                                                                                               
  Because of the dust hazard near closest approach, a magnetometer boom could not                                                 
be included in the spacecraft's design. The resulting magnetic-contamination problem                                              
was attacked by the use of two magnetometers and by a magnetic-cleanliness pro-                                                   
gramme.                                                                                                                           
  First in-flight results show that the instrument itself is working flawlessly, though                                           
some magnetic-contamination problems remain.

------------------------                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                  
  The primary objective of the Giotto Magnetometer Experiment is to study the in-                                                 
teraction between the magneto-plasma of the solar wind and the ionosphere-neutral-                                                
atmosphere system of Comet P/Halley. The most important data for this study will                                                  
be obtained during the second half of 13 March 1986, on the inbound pass, until                                                   
closest approach shortly after midnight early on 14 March 1986. Nevertheless, precur-                                             
sor phenomena can be expected up to a few days before encounter. If the spacecraft                                                
should survive its flyby of the cometary nucleus, the outbound pass will provide addi-                                            
tional important data in view of the asymmetry of the interplanetary magnetic field                                               
with respect to the direction of incident solar-wind flow.                                                                        
  The ideal situation for the study of the flow interaction between any planetary body                                            
and a streaming plasma would be provided by a two-spacecraft mission, with one                                                    
spacecraft passing through the flow system and the second monitoring the solar wind                                               
upstream of the planetary body. In the absence of such a second spacecraft, it is man-                                            
datory to study the solar wind around the time of the encounter. In this sense, solar-                                            
wind studies are a primary objective of this mission. In addition, the mission is of ap-                                          
preciable interest for studying the interplanetary medium per se, because of the cluster                                          
of interplanetary spacecraft performing simultaneous measurements.                                                                
  Finally, the discussion of scientific objectives would be incomplete if the possibility                                         
of a magnetic field internal to Comet Halley were ignored.                                                                        
                                                                                                                                  
1.1 Interaction between Comet Halley and the Solar Wind                                                                           
  The encounter between Giotto and Comet Halley will occur at a distance of 0.89                                                  
AU from the Sun, after the comet has passed perihelion on 9 February 1986. The                                                    
magnetoplasm of the solar wind will then be interacting with the well-developed                                                   
atmosphere-ionosphere system of the comet. Figure 1 shows the classical picture of                                                
this interaction (Wallis, 1973; Schmidt & Wegmann, 1982; Ip & Axford, 1982),                                                      
together with the flyby trajectory of the spacecraft. The flyby occurs from dusk to                                               
dawn at a solar phase angle of 107deg and a relative velocity of 68 km/s.                                                         
  In the classical picture, the neutral gas of the comet is initially expanding radially                                          
away from the nucleus with a velocity of about 1 km/s. Ions with these slow initial                                               
speeds are produced by ionization of cometary neutrals due to EUV-radiation from the                                              
Sun and hot electrons, and by charge exchange with solar-wind ions. These ions are                                                
then picked up by the motional electric field of the local magneto-plasma, which is                                               
provided by the frozen-in field condition. In this mass-loading process, the solar wind                                           
contaminated by cometary ions is decelerated. In the classical picture a relatively weak                                          
shock forms. After passage through the bow shock, the flow is further decelerated and                                             
deflected around the inner coma region by a contact surface provided by a pressure                                                
balance between the inner ionospheric plasma of cometary origin and the outer                                                     
magneto-plasma consisting of solar-wind and cometary ions. In this picture, the

Comet Halley and the solar wind                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                  
magnetic field undergoes a process called 'draping', in which the deceleration of the                                             
plasma near the comet leads to a lag in the portions of the field line near the comet                                             
relative to the distant portions. The kinematic process leads to field-line configurations                                        
reminiscent of hair-pins. The draping process was proposed by Alfven to explain the                                               
tail ray formation as early as 1957. Also the ion pickup process, with its associated                                             
non-equilibrium distribution functions, has been proposed as a source of several                                                  
plasma instabilities generating electromagnetic and electrostatic wave modes (e.g.                                                
Winske et al., 1985).                                                                                                             
  The general picture just described has been confirmed in several aspects by the flyby                                           
of the International Cometary Explorer spacecraft at Comet Giacobini-Zinner (G - Z)                                               
on 11 September 1985. The draping process has been confirmed, with magnetic fields                                                
as high as 55 nT in the induced tail of the comet (ICE Press Conference; personal co-                                             
munications by E.J. Smith and J.C. Brandt, 1985). Although the transition from                                                    
supersonic to subsonic flow occurred at the expected distance of 1.4 x 10**5 km from                                              
the tail-axis, it was not connected with a shock of familiar signature. Among the other                                           
unexpected results were the discovery of high-energy particles with energies that can-                                            
not be explained by the pickup process alone, and the occurrence of strong magnetic-                                              
field turbulence up to the Nyquist frequency of the ICE magnetometer experiment of                                                
1.5 Hz. It is very probable that these observations are related. We note that the flyby                                           
trajectories for P/Halley and P/G-Z are very similar in the cometary frame of                                                     
reference at large distances from the comet. At closer distances, the differences are                                             
significant in that the point of closest approach will be at 500 km sunward for Giotto,                                           
in contrast to the 8000 km tailward for the ICE mission.                                                                          
  Comet-like interactions have been observed before, most extensively by the                                                      
Pioneer-Venus-Orbiter mission (e.g. Russell & Vaisberg, 1983; Cloutier et al., 1983).                                             
but also during the Voyager-1 encounter at Titan on 12 November 1980 (Ness et al.,                                                
1982; Neubauer et al., 1984).                                                                                                     
  At Comet Halley we expect a much larger interaction region with the solar wind                                                  
compared with P/G-Z, due to the much larger gas production rate. This is expected                                                 
to lead not only to quantitative, but also to qualitative differences from Comet G - Z.                                           
On Giotto, the region close to the comet will be particularly interesting, as a contact                                           
surface at a distance of several 1000 km is expected, enclosing a volume with zero                                                
magnetic field inside the cometary counterpart of the Venus ionopause.                                                            
  The following sequence of events is then expected under average solar-wind condi-                                               
tions. High-energy particles of cometary origin will excite electromagnetic wave                                                  
modes which may already be 'seen' two days before encounter. The shock or 'shock-                                                 
like' transition region is expected at about 1.1 X 10**6 km from closest approach, i.e.                                           
4.5 h before minimum distance to the nucleus. We then expect highly turbulent regions                                             
with an increase in magnetic-field magnitude towards the magnetic field pile-up region                                            
on the sunward side of the nucleus. At about 1 min before closest approach, we may                                                
encounter the cometary ionopause or contact surface, with an abrupt decrease of the                                               
field from more than 100 nT to zero. In the field-free region, we may also be able                                                
to observe the cometary counterpart of flux-ropes detected at Venus (Russell &                                                    
Elphic, 1979). The value of the inbound observations would be more than doubled if                                                
outbound observations were also available.                                                                                        
  As far as the turbulence in the cometary magnetosheath is concerned, we note that                                               
many interesting wave modes are confined to frequencies well below the lower hybrid                                               
frequency. One of the important length scales is a thermal ion gyro radius for other                                              
investigations. The frequency resolution of the experiment must then be adequate to                                               
resolve the resulting time scales along most of the encounter trajectory. The main ob-                                            
jectives are then:                                                                                                                
(i)   study of precursor wave phenomena far from the comet                                                                        
(ii)  identification and investigation of plasma boundaries, i.e. the bow shock or its                                            
      cometary counterpart, the cometary ionopause, etc.                                                                          
(iii) investigation of plasma turbulence                                                                                          
(iv)  study of plasma phenomena related to optical observations from the ground.                                                  
                                                                                                                                  
1.2 Interplanetary magnetic-field studies                                                                                         
  We have already mentioned the importance of knowing the solar-wind conditions                                                   
in the region of space around the comet close to the time of encounter. For example,                                              
in order to assess the complete history of a typical neutral-gas molecule, from its time                                          
of release from the surface of the nucleus to the time when it loads the solar wind at                                            
10**6 km from the nucleus, we need to know the solar wind incident on the comet for                                               
about 9 days. Extending this argument, a period of solar-wind observations during at                                              
least one solar rotation before encounter is necessary.                                                                           
 Also, the encounter at Comet Halley will occur at a time of solar minimum, when                                                  
the solar wind is expected to be dominated by a few stable high-speed streams issuing                                             
from well-defined coronal holes. The magnetic field will be dominated by a well-                                                  
defined sector structure. Although the solar-wind structure near 1 AU has been studied                                            
in detail in the past, the cluster of spacecraft now aimed at Comet Halley provides a                                             
unique opportunity to study it with a two-dimensional array in the ecliptic. Potential                                            
contributors to such a study are the ICE, Vega-1, Vega-2, Planet-A, MS-T5 and                                                     
Giotto spacecraft. Obviously, such a study requires adequate telemetry coverage for                                               
these missions.                                                                                                                   
 The primary objectives can then be summarized as follows:                                                                        
(i)  establishment of the solar-wind magneto-plasma environment of Comet Halley                                                   
     for several weeks before encounter                                                                                           
(ii) study of solar-wind macrostructure of co-rotating and propagating features.                                                  
                                                                                                                                  
1.3 The possibility of an internal magnetic field for Comet Halley                                                                
 Because of its cosmogonic significance, it is worthwhile discussing briefly the                                                  
possibility of Comet Halley possessing an internal magnetic field, and its possible                                               
detection. The only possibility seems to be that the dust component of the nucleus                                                
possesses some natural remnant magnetization. If, for example, the cometary nucleus                                               
had accreted in a strong magnetic field, such magnetization could have been produced                                              
by a process analogous to depositional remnant magnetization in palaeo-magnetism.                                                 
The degree of magnetization would depend on the chemistry and structure of the ac-                                                
creting grains and the primordial field. Since these inputs are not known, let us assume                                          
for simplicity that the nonvolatile component of the cometary nucleus has an extreme                                              
magnetization corresponding to 10**-3 emu/g, which is high for values measured                                                    
in meteorites. In second Gaussian position, this would lead to about 200 nT on the sur-                                           
face of the nucleus, if we assume a dipole field due to uniform magnetization. With                                               
a radius of 1.5 km for the nucleus of Comet Halley, the distance of closest approach                                              
would have to be 7 km (!) from the centre for the magnetic field to be marginally                                                 
detectable. We therefore conclude that the establishment of at least a useful upper limit                                         
on the magnetization of the nucleus must await a close approach by a rendezvous                                                   
mission.                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                  
2.  The Instrumentation                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                  
The design of any scientific instrument must take into account the scientific objec-                                              
tives of the investigation and the spacecraft's resources, such as mass, power,                                                   
telemetry rate, telemetry coverage assigned to the experiment, and contamination of                                               
the measurements by the spacecraft environment, as well as details of the implementa-                                             
tion of the development and test programme on the ground.                                                                         
  In the case of the magnetometer investigation, the scientific objectives led to several                                         
requirements. Our objective is to resolve electromagnetic plasma waves up to the                                                  
lower hybrid resonance frequency under reasonable magneto-plasma conditions and                                                   
to resolve spatial scale lengths down to several ion gyro radii at the flyby velocity of                                          
68 km/s. The maximum sampling rate of 28.24 vectors per second used during en-                                                    
counter fulfils this requirement reasonably well. Because of the modest expected                                                  
telemetry coverage during cruise to the comet and the short time interval of 4 h iden-                                            
tified as the encounter phase proper, the inclusion of an experiment memory was con-                                              
sidered absolutely necessary at the time of experiment design.                                                                    
  The measuring ranges of the experiment are determined by the necessity to observe                                               
the interplanetary magnetic field before the encounter, with an average magnitude of                                              
5 nT, and the maximum fields expected near the comet of several 100 nT. Since                                                     
ground testing of a magnetometer experiment designed for the observation of weak                                                  
fields is generally difficult because of the presence of the geomagnetic field of about                                           
50 000 nT at intermediate latitudes, measuring ranges up to +/- 65 536 nT were included                                           
for test purposes.                                                                                                                
  The quantization uncertainty of the analogue-to-digital conversion process is given                                             
by the requirement that the associated errors should not diminish the overall accuracy                                            
in the most sensitive ranges. Hence 12-bit analogue-to-digital conversion has been                                                
selected.                                                                                                                         
  Very severe limitations were set by the mass and power assigned to this experiment,                                             
together with the grim magnetic-cleanliness situation. Consequently, it was not possi-                                            
ble to include any hardware redundancy in the experiment. Hence the hardware's                                                    
reliability is lower than that of other magnetometer experiments, such as those on the                                            
Voyager mission and the coming Ulysses mission, for example. To achieve satisfac-                                                 
tory reliability, simple design, limited operational redundancy, particularly careful                                             
workmanship and careful parts selection have been emphasized.                                                                     
  The Giotto spacecraft has been designed to reach an encounter distance of several                                               
100 km without being destroyed by the flux of dust particles at a relative speed of                                               
68 km/s. This has been achieved by employing a dust shield, which is also shown                                                   
in Figure 2. This design also precludes any protruding spacecraft appendages such as                                              
a magnetometer boom. The two magnetometer sensor systems (MAG-1 and MAG-2)                                                        
are therefore mounted on the antenna tripod carrying the feed for the despun antenna                                              
disc and the omni-directional antenna, as shown in Figure 2. In the early phase of the                                            
project, when the baseline design contained only one sensor system (MAG-1), it                                                    
became clear that the magnetic contamination of the measurements at the position of                                               
MAG-1 would be worse than expected. The project agreed to add an additional sensor                                                
system (MAG-4) to reduce the pressure on the magnetic-cleanliness specifications.                                                 
The slight mass increase was absorbed by the agreement of the magnetometer team                                                   
to provide also certain experiment interface units which had previously been included                                             
in the mass budget of the spacecraft system. The evolution in the magnetometer ex-                                                
periment's design has been described previously by Neubauer (1981) and Neubauer                                                   
et al. (1983). In contrast to other space projects involving magnetometer experiments,                                            
the magnetic-cleanliness programme on Giotto was largely the responsibility of the                                                
magnetometer team. It will be described in Section 3.

    mounted on the antenna tripod                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                  
 Owing to the severe power and mass limitations, the only type of magnetometer that                                               
could be used was a fluxgate magnetometer of the ring-core type, with its superior                                                
performance in terms of low noise level and high zero-stability, and its low mass and                                             
power consumption. A schematic of the Giotto Magnetometer Experiment, which will                                                  
be explained in detail below, is shown in Figure 3.                                                                               
  The Experiment consists of three hardware units, aside from the various connection                                              
cables. The magnetometer electronics box, referred to as MAG-2 in project parlance,                                               
is mounted on the underside of the top spacecraft platform. It contains the                                                       
magnetometer electronics proper and the digital processor. Two fluxgate sensor                                                    
Systems, MAG-1 and MAG-4, are mounted on the antenna tripod. The main MAG-1                                                       
magnetometer is a triaxial fluxgate magnetometer. The additional magnetometer,                                                    
MAG-4, is a biaxial one with an axis parallel to the +Z(M)  axis of the spacecraft and                                            
an axis in the X(M) Y(M) plane parallel to one of the axes of the outboard magnetometer                                           
MAG-1. The five magnetic-field components are referred to as XOB, YOB, ZOB, XIB                                                   
and ZIB, with OB meaning outboard and IB meaning inboard. The temperatures of

The Giotto Magnetometer Experiment had to be of a completely new design because                                                   
of the stringent mass and power limitations, though it follows the design principles                                              
of the highly successful Voyager magnetometer experiment (Behannon et al., 1977;                                                  
Acuna, 1974).                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                  
In all fluxgate magnetometers, a ferromagnetic core of soft magnetic material is                                                  
periodically  driven into saturation by the magnetic field of a drive coil, which is                                              
energized by a periodic current form of suitable shape at the drive frequency                                                     
f(0) 15.1499 kHz in the case of Giotto. The drive coil, the magnetic core and an ad-                                              
ditional sense coil form a transformer in which the sense coil picks up a voltage at                                              
the drive frequency f(0) and ideally its odd harmonics only, if no ambient field is pre-                                          
sent. In the presence of an ambient magnetic field component H(a) parallel to the sen-                                            
sitive direction of the sense winding, even harmonics show up. In reality, a small                                                
zero-offset exists, corresponding to small-amplitude even harmonics at zero ambient                                               
field. To obtain the magnetic-field component H(a), the second harmonic at 2 f(0) is                                              
generally used, with an amplitude proportional to the ambient H(a) component just                                                 
defined. To improve linearity, the sense-coil output is used to control the current                                               
through a feedback coil, which produces a magnetic field compensating the ambient                                                 
field. In this respect, the sense coil output is used to detect a zero resultant field.                                           
 A functional block diagram, which also applies to the Giotto Magnetometer Experi-                                                
ment, is shown in Figure 4 for one axis. In Giotto's case the sense and feedback coils                                            
are physically identical, because the sense signal around 2 f(0) and the feedback signal                                          
are well separated in frequency.                                                                                                  
 At the time of procurement for the Giotto magnetometer, the magnetic material used                                               
in the ring-core sensors was the latest in a series of advanced molybdenum permalloy

alloys and the ring-core geometry allowed the development of a compact, low-noise                                                 
and low-zero-drift instrument with low power consumption. Over the range of                                                       
operating temperatures from -50deg to +60deg C, the zero stability turned out to be                                               
+/-0.2 nT in laboratory measurements. The noise level is better than about 0.003 nT

 The resistance in the feedback circuit determines the instrument's sensitivity, i.e.                                             
the constant of proportionality between the magnetic-field component H(a) and the                                                 
voltage U(a) in Figure 4. Nominally, it is given by R(F). Range switching is achieved by                                          
changing the resistivity of the feedback circuit by electronic switching of various                                               
resistors. The Giotto magnetometer experiment has seven measuring ranges, noted in                                                
Table 3. More precisely, the outboard magnetometer can make use of the seven ranges                                               
R1,... R7, whereas the inboard magnetometer is in range R3 whenever the outboard                                                  
magnetometer is in R1, R2 or R3, and in the same range as MAG-1 for all less-                                                     
sensitive ranges.                                                                                                                 
 The quantization uncertainties due to the 12-bit analogue-to-digital conversion have                                             
also been included in Table 3.                                                                                                    
 The ranges used are controlled by the digital processor of the experiment. They can                                              
either be set 'manually' by telecommand to a selected range, or be determined by a                                                
digital processor subprogram in automatic mode. In automatic mode, selected by                                                    
telecommand from the ground, the range can be adapted to the measured magnetic                                                    
field every eighth frame (see below) during real-time data transmissions. Up-ranging                                              
or down-ranging occur depending on whether magnetic-field components appear in an                                                 
upper or lower guard band shown in Figure 5.                                                                                      
 As a limited functional check, the experiment can also be commanded into a sen-                                                  
sitivity calibration mode in which a calibration field corresponding to one quarter of                                            
the range is applied in any odd range, i.e. R1 or R3 or R5 or R7.                                                                 
 The frequency transfer function T(f) for each magnetometer axis is given by the                                                  
functional form

  We have already mentioned one of the tasks of the digital data processor of the                                                 
Giotto Magnetometer Experiment, namely the control of the various measuring                                                       
ranges. The functional units of the processor are included in Figure 3. It has the                                                
following tasks:                                                                                                                  
(i)   timing of measurements in real time and memory mode                                                                         
(ii)  range control                                                                                                               
(iii) averaging of memory mode vectors                                                                                            
(iv)  collection of housekeeping data                                                                                             
(v)   telemetry interfacing                                                                                                       
(vi)  command reception and implementation.                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                  
The heart of the digital processing system is an RCA CDP 1802/MPU-1                                                               
microprocessor with 16 kbyte of RAM and 5.5 kbyte of PROM, operating at                                                           
1.939 MHz.                                                                                                                        
  The first task of the processor is to provide the timing for the real-time                                                      
measurements. These are timed synchronously with the spacecraft telemetry system.                                                 
The spacecraft real-time telemetry system has three formats for science data transmis-                                            
sion. These formats, FM1, FM2 and FM3, last for 68/3 s, 68/3 s and 136/3 s,                                                       
respectively, for the highest possible bit rates (total spacecraft bit rate 46 kbit/s).                                           
Formats FM1 and FM2 can also be operated at half the maximum bit rates. Formats                                                   
FM1, FM2 and FM3 include 64, 64 and 16 frames, respectively. The number of                                                        
magnetic-field vectors measured by the outboard magnetometer in these formats is                                                  
640,640 and 400, respectively. For the Magnetometer Experiment, FM1 and FM2                                                       
are identical and as a result it has three sampling rates for real-time data transmission                                         
(Table 4).                                                                                                                        
  The real-time data modes are also used to dump the experiment memory. Approx-                                                   
imately 15 kbyte of the experiment's 16 kbyte RAM can be used to store magnetic-field                                             
vectors over extended time periods to bridge gaps in telemetry coverage. Because of                                               
the 4 s spin period of the spacecraft, this has to be done in synchronization with the                                            
spin, given by the Sun Reference Pulse (SRP). Two memory modes are available. In                                                  
cruise mode, blocks of 32 vectors are read into the memory, where each of the 32                                                  
vectors is the result of averaging magnetic-field vectors obtained at the SRP over N                                              
spin periods, where N can be any power of 2 between N=1 and N=128. The selection                                                  
is made by telecommand. Hence the averaging times range between 4 s and 512 s                                                     
(8.53 min). In the latter case a 10 d gap in telemetry coverage could be bridged.                                                 
  The second memory mode, called the 'snapshot' mode, also uses blocks of 32 vec-                                                 
tors. However, these alternate between blocks containing 'snapshots' of the magnetic                                              
field. Every 'snapshot' consists of 32 vectors measured spin-synchronously at a rate                                              
of eight vectors per spin period over four spin periods. The idea of the snapshot                                                 
memory mode was to provide a means to monitor the spacecraft magnetic field during                                                
telemetry gaps. Gaps of up to 5 d can be closed by the snapshot mode. In both memory                                              
modes, inboard and outboard components are measured at the same rate. The time of                                                 
the measurements in memory mode is obtained by an experiment clock. The experi-                                                   
ment clock is synchronized with the spacecraft clock after switch-on of the ex-

  The memory dump occurs automatically when real-time telemetry is available and                                                  
the experiment is still switched into memory mode. Nominally, the memory readout                                                  
is performed after a 'memory-dump' command. The readout of the memory lasts from                                                  
95 s to 5 min in format 1 at a high telemetry bit rate and in format 3, respectively.

  The data processor also collects the experiment housekeeping information. From the                                              
2040 words of a housekeeping frame, which lasts one format, eight words have been                                                 
assigned to the Magnetometer Experiment. The housekeeping data provide informa-

  The data processor also implements the commands sent to the experiment from the                                                 
ground. Commands use 16-bit words which specify the desired overall state of the ex-

and to label the memory content by a command identification number. The operational                                               
modes are sensitivity calibration, real-time mode, cruise mode and snapshot mode.

fields due to magnetic materials and electric currents in the spacecraft electronics.                                             
This problem is generally referred to as the 'magnetic-cleanliness' problem. On Giot-                                             
to, the accuracy requirements for the Magnetometer Experiment are not much lower                                                  
than for a typical interplanetary mission near 1 AU, because only a small time interval                                           
during encounter is expected to yield field magnitudes above typical interplanetary                                               
ones. These requirements have to be contrasted with the difficulties due to the lack                                              
of a magnetometer boom and due to the presence of severe sources of magnetic con-

  A detailed magnetic-cleanliness programme was carried out in the course of the                                                  
Giotto project. In contrast to other projects, this programme was the responsibility of                                           
the magnetometer team, although some support was provided by the project. For all                                                 
spacecraft subsystems and experiments, the maximum allowed magnetic field at the                                                  
position of MAG-1 was specified for the deperm state of the switched-off spacecraft,                                              
for a perm state achieved by a 3 Gauss perm, and for the stray-field contribution due                                             
to electrically powering the unit.                                                                                                
  Most spacecraft subsystems and experiments or subunits thereof were magnetically                                                
mapped in detail in the Magnetic Coil Facility at the Technical University of                                                     
Braunschweig or a Mobile Coil Facility provided by the experiment team and                                                        
deployed in Bristol, Toulouse and Kourou during the various project phases to make                                                
optimum use of the time available for these activities. About 150 detailed test reports                                           
were issued in the course of the programme.

Final deperm            4.2                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                  
clean hardware were established and advice given to experimenters and spacecraft                                                  
subcontractors regarding fulfilment of the specifications. The need to achieve field                                              
stability, and not so much a low magnetic-field magnitude, was emphasized in this                                                 
respect. On the stray-field side, self-compensation of currents was stressed in design-                                           
ing the solar-panel harness and parts of the electrical circuitry.                                                                
  The result of the cleanliness programme was checked via a System Magnetic Test                                                  
in the IABG Coil Facility in Ottobrunn, near Munich, in March 1985. Table 5 shows                                                 
some of the results.                                                                                                              
 These results are representative for the Giotto flight spacecraft, except that the flight-                                       
model camera was not included. They show that the magnetic-cleanliness programme                                                  
was very effective indeed. If, for example, there had been a 3 m long magnetometer                                                
boom extending from the spacecraft's centre, the final deperm field at the end of this                                            
beam would have been 0.9 nT.                                                                                                      
  The most difficult permanent-magnet problem was caused by the two motors of the                                                 
despin motor assembly. With the magnetic moments of the motors parallel to each                                                   
other, the field at MAG-1 was 550 nT. In the self-compensating assembly, the                                                      
magnetic field at MAG-1 was 76 nT. After the mounting of a compensator device with                                                
two precision magnets, the field at MAG-1 was 7 nT. It could have been even smaller,                                              
had it not been used for a limited system compensation.                                                                           
  In summary, we can say that for all units subjected to the full mapping and field-                                              
reduction procedures of the magnetic-cleanliness programme, a satisfactory solution                                               
was found. This is also true for the overall stray field, not shown in Table 5.                                                   
  The two major problems that remained could not be subjected to the cleanliness pro-                                             
gramme satisfactorily because of severe schedule problems; they are the stray fields                                              
due to the despin motor and due to the operation of the camera motors. Figure 6 shows                                             
two short intervals of raw data obtained in flight, which show these disturbances.                                                
Figure 6a shows a quiet interplanetary magnetic field seen from the spinning Giotto                                               
spacecraft with a superposed, very regular component at the spin frequency due to the                                             
despin motor. In the case of the Z-component, the despin motor accounts for most of                                               
the spin variation. The results of the System Magnetic Test show that the noise most                                              
visible on the Z-trace is also due solely to the despin motor. Figure 6b shows addi-                                              
tional disturbances due to the camera motor's operations.                                                                         
                                                                                                                                  
3.2 Use of the two sensor systems MAG-1 and MAG-4                                                                                 
  Since the ambient magnetic field to be measured is the same at the MAG-1 and                                                    
MAG-4 locations, the difference in the readings of the components of MAG-1 and                                                    
MAG-4 is entirely due to the spacecraft fields which vary as a function of position                                               
near the spacecraft. Because the System Magnetic Test has shown that the main parts                                               
of the stray-field components of the despin motor at MAG-1 and MAG-4 are simply                                                   
related, the difference in readings at MAG-1 and MAG-4 can be used to determine                                                   
this field unambiguously and then to correct for it. We will also attempt to use this                                             
technique to remove the camera stray field at the times when it is operating.                                                     
                                                                                                                                  
3.3 Inflight spacecraft magnetic-field determination                                                                              
  The spin variation of the magnetic field in the spin plane can be used to determine                                             
the spacecraft magnetic-field components in this plane and the small sensor offsets.                                              
For the Z-components, we will determine the slowly varying part of the spacecraft                                                 
field by statistical techniques based on the physical properties of interplanetary                                                
magnetic-field fluctuations (e.g. Hedgecock, 1975).

Instrumentation in Flight                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                  
  The magnetometer experiment was the first experiment of the Giotto payload to be                                                
switched on, on 22 August 1985. It has worked flawlessly ever since.                                                              
  Two short intervals of raw data are shown in Figures 6a and b. They are based on                                                
data from the quick-look data stations, which are not of sufficient quantity to allow                                             
the application of the full data-analysis programme. The spacecraft magnetic field in                                             
the X, Y-plane has been estimated to be about 8 nT from these data.

  The Giotto Magnetometer Experiment is a low-mass, low-power instrument, which                                                   
will provide magnetic-field measurements within some 500 km or less of the nucleus                                                
  Comet Halley for the first time. In addition, it will provide high-time-resolution                                              
observations of the plasma environment of this unique comet.                                                                      
  The design of the instrumentation and the data-analysis system had to take into ac-                                             
count a high level of magnetic interference from the Giotto spacecraft itself.                                                    
  The scientific interpretation of the data will be a collaborative effort between all                                            
members of the team who have made the experiment possible.
