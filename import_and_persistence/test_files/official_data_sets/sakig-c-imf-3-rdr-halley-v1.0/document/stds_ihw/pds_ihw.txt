                               PDS LABELS                                     
                                                                              
                                                                              
     The International Halley Watch agreed early in the project that all data 
would be submitted from the individual scientists to the Lead Center using    
the FITS format (Wells et al., 1981).  When the decision was made to          
distribute this information on CD-ROM, it was determined that the data had to 
have even broader accessibility.  For this reason the original FITS files,    
with contiguous headers and data, were split into separate files              
distinguishable by their filename extensions (.HDR for headers).  The file    
sizes were preserved as multiples of 2880 bytes, allowing the original FITS   
byte stream to be recovered by concatenating the appropriate header and       
datafile.                                                                     
                                                                              
     In addition, detached (PDS) labels were constructed to allow parallel    
definition of the data files for the Planetary Data System (PDS). The         
reference for this project are as follows: SPIDS, Standards for the           
Preparation and Interchange of Data Sets, Martin, T. Z., et al, V1.1, JPL

     There are three data objects in this archive: ARRAY (COLLECTION), IMAGE, 
TABLE (TIME_SERIES as a subset).  Our aim was to construct a PDS label for    
each data file on the CD-ROM. These PDS labels contain pointers to the actual 
data files (or to headers describing data submitted to the archive). There has
been no effort to duplicate the documentation contained in the full FITS      
headers because the PDS and FITS headers for a given data file differ only in 
the filename extension.  Instead we have attempted to use the power of the PDS
label syntax to fully describe the data structures and thus gain access to the
powerful software already supported by that group.                            
                                                                              
     Most keywords were already in the Planetary Science Data Dictionary but a
few dealing with the ARRAY and TIME_SERIES were introduced to specifically    
describe the IHW data.   A listing of these keywords with definitions follow.
