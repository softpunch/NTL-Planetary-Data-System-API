1. Scientific Objectives                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                  
Japan's Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS) first decided in 1979 to                                              
send a spacecraft to Comet Halley. This decision was supported both by Japanese                                                   
scientists who were anxious to carry out an interplanetary mission and by those                                                   
Institute engineers who wanted to demonstrate the capabilities of a new launch vehicle.                                           
Comet Halley was considered a scientifically meaningful target because it has never                                               
been explored previously from close-range, it displays a wide range of interesting                                                
phenomema, and it returns only once every 76 years.                                                                               
  The Japanese mission to Comet Halley, called the 'Planet-A' mission, involved the                                               
launch of the 'Suisei', or Planet-A, spacecraft on 19 August 1985, to encounter Comet                                             
Halley in March 1986. In keeping with our normal procedure of launching a test                                                    
spacecraft to confirm the flight performance of a newly developed launch system and                                               
the necessary technology for the main mission, a test spacecraft called 'Sakigake' (i.e.                                          
Pioneer), or MS-T5, was launched on 8 January 1985. Hence, the Planet-A project                                                   
actually involves two spacecraft, Planet-A and MS-T5.                                                                             
  Initial calculations based on launcher performance and mission requirements led to                                              
a mass of about 140 kg for each spacecraft, allowing a scientific payload consisting                                              
of two or three experiments, each typically weighing 5 kg. An EUV imaging experi-

plasma waves, solar-wind plasma and the interplanetary magnetic field.                                                            
  Planet-A has two major scientific objectives:

-   to study the solar-wind plasma and, if possible, determine the signatures of the                                              
    solar-wind/comet interaction at large distances from the comet.                                                               
                                                                                                                                  
The scientific experiments carried by Planet-A and MS-T5 are described below; the                                                 
masses, powers and data rates are summarized later in Tables 6 and 7, respectively.

2.1 Ultra-Violet Imager (UVI)                                                                                                     
  The main role of the Ultra-Violet Imager (UVI) is to obtain a succession of synoptic                                            
images of Halley's hydrogen corona. The latter originates from the photo-dissociation                                             
of water vapour released from the water ice, which is a major constituent of the                                                  
volatile components in the comet nucleus. The imaging for several months around the                                               
Halley encounter (November 1985 to April 1986) will have to cope with a wide range                                                
of heliocentric distances for Halley, with the Sun-Halley-spacecraft geometry                                                     
changing continuously. This will allow us to obtain information about the heliocentric                                            
variation of the hydrogen production rate, velocity distributions of hydrogen atoms,                                              
etc. The significance of these observations will be enhanced if they can be combined                                              
with observations from other Halley or Earth-orbiting spacecraft (three-dimensional                                               
imaging).                                                                                                                         
  Figure 1a shows a protoflight model of the UVI camera, and Figure 1b a cross-

system. The later consists of a UV Image Intensifier (UVII) and Charge-Coupled                                                    
Device (CCD) detector. A block diagram of the UVI is shown in Figure 2.                                                           
  Since Planet-A is a spinning spacecraft, the telescope viewing direction at the time                                            
of taking the image is determined by the elapsed time between imaging and Sun-sensor                                              
output by the elevation angle of the guiding mirror. The UVII acts simultaneously as                                              
an image convertor for the CCD image pickup.                                                                                      
  The image from the UVII lies essentially in the H alpha wavelength range, because the                                           
peak in the spectral response of the UVII photocathode material (KBr) resides in the

the brightness detection limit (1 kR) requirement, the CCD is operated in Spin-                                                   
Synchronized Shift (S3) drive mode. In this mode, the CCD charge pattern, which is                                                
induced by the optical image input, is transferred to the next position with the same                                             
speed of optical image shift on the CCD photo-sensitive area as the spacecraft spin.                                              
In the next position, the newly induced charge pattern is superimposed on the previous                                            
one. This produces a time-integrated image of the object by successive superposition.                                             
The UVI is only operated when the spacecraft spin is reduced to 0.2 rpm (see Sec-                                                 
tion 5), in order to provide a sufficiently long integration time for the CCD. The CCP                                            
chip is cooled to - 30degC to reduce the dark current. The device's image output is                                               
analogue-to-digital converted and read into a microcomputer. The compressed data                                                  
are then read into the spacecraft's data recorder. Table 1 summarizes the UVIs

The UVI works in three operational modes:  'search', 'observation' and                                                            
'photometer.' The search mode is intended for the initial finding of P/Halley. The                                                
comet 'hunt' is to be carried out over an area centred around the anticipated location                                            
of the comet, obtained from orbital calculations. After comet identification, the                                                 
camera will be operated with a frequency tuned to the rate of the hydrogen corona's                                               
growth or change processes. Inside the corona, the camera will be operated in                                                     
photometer mode. Because of its field of view (2.5deg x2.5deg), a photo-mosaic of the                                             
complete corona will be compiled from many pictures taken over a period of about                                                  
two weeks around the closest approach to Halley.                                                                                  
  The instrument is controlled completely by ground command and an open-loop con-

 2.2  Solar-Wind Experiment (ESP)                                                                                                 
 The objective of this experiment is to measure the three-dimensional velocity                                                    
distributions of the solar-wind ions and electrons in the energy range from 30 eV up                                              
to 16 keV within +/- 30deg of the ecliptic plane.                                                                                 
  During the cometary encounter, the interaction of the solar wind with the cometary                                              
ionosphere will be investigated, paying particular attention to the mass loading of the                                           
solar wind by cometary ions, to the existence, location and strength of the upstream                                              
shock transition and of (possibly) backscattered particles from the shock and other,                                              
unexpected, plasma populations. Data will be collected on such solar-wind phenomena                                               
as the halo and core distributions of electrons, variations in the flow velocity, and the                                         
He++/He+ ratio in relation to solar rotation and longitude.                                                                       
  The instrument consists of one sensor for electrons and one for positive ions. As                                               
shown in Figure 3, each sensor consists of a fan-shaped collimator, a 270deg spherical                                            
electrostatic analyzer, and a Micro-Channel Plate (MCP) detector with five discrete                                               
anodes. The collimator's field of view is 5deg in azimuth and 60deg in polar angle, respec-                                       
tively, the latter being centred perpendicular to the spacecraft spin axis and thus in                                            
the ecliptic plane. The 270deg spherical analyzer has a better-defined response in energy-                                        
angle space than a quadrispherical analyzer.                                                                                      
  A block diagram of the experiment is shown in Figure 4. After leaving the analyzer,                                             
particles are post-accelerated by a potential of 250 V for electron and 2500 - 3500 V                                             
for ion analysis. A Z-type three-stacked MCP detector is used to obtain a saturated                                               
pulse-height distribution over a wide dynamic range of counting rates. The anodes of

tion with a 12deg resolution in the polar direction. The output pulses from each MCP                                              
anode are amplified, shaped and accumulated in 19-bit counters. The contents of the                                               
counter are compressed into 8 bits and stored temporarily in the RAM buffer memory.                                               
 The instrument's angular distribution in the azimuthal direction, obtained by using                                              
the spacecraft spin, is 5.625deg within +/- 22.5deg of the solar direction and 22.5deg in the                                     
remaining spin phase.                                                                                                             
 The instrument has four modes of energy scanning (Table 2). In each mode the                                                     
energy is scanned in steps as E(n)=30 exp (0.0066n), where E(n) is the energy of the                                              
n-th step and n=n(1), . . . . .,n(2). Details of the energy scanning, which is synchronis-                                        
ed to the spin phase, are shown for the E1-mode in Figure 5. During each spacecraft                                               
spin four energy steps are scanned periodically in every 22.5deg interval, i.e. the step                                          
is changed every 1.40625deg around the solar direction and 5.625deg over the remaining                                            
azimuthal directions. Consequently, it takes 24 spacecraft spins in the E1-mode to                                                
cover the complete energy range in 96 steps.                                                                                      
 At high bit rate (2048 bit/s), three-dimensional velocity distributions will be obtain-                                          
ed for both electrons and ions. These data, produced during one spin, will be transmit-                                           
ted in 10 PCM frames (5 s) during the next spin interval. At low bit rate (64 bit/s),                                             
two-dimensional distributions will be obtained for electrons and ions by summing the                                              
counts from each anode. As shown in the lower part of Figure 5, the energy scanning                                               
will be carried out over 16 spin periods once every 512 s, required to transmit these                                             
data.                                                                                                                             
 The ESP instrument will be operated during the Halley-encounter phase as well as                                                 
during the cruise and post-encounter phases, but only while Planet-A is in its high-

 Many plasma-wave phenomena in the interplanetary medium are associated with                                                      
turbulence in the solar-wind plasma. Plasma waves may also play an important role                                                 
in the generation of the cometary ion tail, which is believed to be formed by                                                     
wave - particle interactions due to the effective viscosity of the interplanetary plasma                                          
and collisions between tail plasma and solar-wind plasma.                                                                         
  The main objectives of the Plasma-Wave Probe (Fig. 6) are to measure electrostatic                                              
plasma waves near the local plasma frequency and whistler-mode waves. In addition,                                                
type-III radio bursts originating from electron beams ejected from the Sun and                                                    
electromagnetic waves emitted from the comet will be monitored.                                                                   
  The plasma-wave sensors (Table 3) consist of a dipole antenna, measuring 10 m                                                   
from tip-to-tip and operated over a wide dynamic frequency range (70 Hz-200 kHz),                                                 
and a search coil to measure the magnetic-field components of electromagnetic                                                     
whistler-mode waves in the frequency range 70 Hz-2.8 kHz. The latter employs                                                      
10**5 turns, wound on a ferrite core of 5 mm diameter.                                                                            
  Both sensors of the plasma-wave instrument (Fig. 7) are selectively connected to                                                
pre-amplifiers, with input thresholds of 0.1 micro V for the electric-field and 5 pT for the                                      
magnetic-field component. The amplified electric-field signals are analyzed by a

3.2  Solar-Wind Instrument (SOW)                                                                                                  
  The Solar-Wind Instrument on MS-T5 employs a Faraday cup to measure the bulk                                                    
velocity, density and temperature of solar-wind ions. This conventional cup, mounted                                              
flush with the outer skin of the spacecraft, consists of four grids and an ion collector                                          
(Fig. 8). The front grid G(1), is connected to the satellite skin. A square-wave voltage                                          
is applied to the modulator grid G(2), alternating at 400 Hz between 0 and V volt. This                                           
produces a pulsating current by repelling and transmitting those incoming particles                                               
whose energy is between 0 and a maximum voltage V of 1.5 kV, which can be selected                                                
from the ground. The voltage will be fixed for most of the mission, although the                                                  
instrument has several operating modes, such as automatic voltage change for every                                                
spin, automatic fine voltage sweep between two voltages, etc. The third grid is                                                   
grounded to block any leakage of modulating voltage from G(2) to the collector. The                                               
fourth grid is negatively biased at - 100 V to suppress photo-electrons from the                                                  
collector. The sensor is not sensitive to the solar-wind stream beyond an angle of                                                
attack of +/- 60deg. Table 4 summarizes the sensor's characteristics.                                                             
 Figure 9 is a block diagram of the instrument. Both DC and AC collector currents                                                 
are detected. The DC currents (ion current and secondary-electron current), which                                                 
vary during each satellite spin, are used to check the angular characteristic of the                                              
Faraday cup itself and to monitor the photo-electron contribution to the collector                                                
current. The modulated ion current measured between 2x10**-12 A and 10**-8 A is                                                   
sampled at 128 points between - 90deg and +90deg with respect to the solar-wind                                                   
direction, i.e. every 180deg/128=1.4deg the collector current is sampled as a function of                                         
the spin angle. The bulk velocity and ion density are calculated from the point where                                             
the slope of the collector-current versus spin angle function becomes a maximum.

  The Interplanetary Magnetic-Field Experiment is designed to study macroscopic and                                               
microscopic  structures  in  the  helio-magnetosphere  and  in  the  cometary

solar wind. The data gathered will be compared with the configuration, brightness and                                             
variations of Halley's corona, which will be imaged by the UV camera on Planet-A.

of the spacecraft into orbit.

Halley to study the macroscopic structure of the helio-magnetosphere and the

Planet-A (Fig. l2) and MS-T5 (Figs. 13, 14) are identical spacecraft except for their                                             
scientific payloads. The main spacecraft body is a cylinder, 140 cm in diameter and                                               
70 cm high. The spinning spacecraft is about 250 cm high, from the top of the high-                                               
gain antenna dish to the bottom of the medium-gain antenna. Its outer wall is covered                                             
by solar cells which produce 100 W of power under optimum conditions. An                                                          
equipment platform mounted to a central thrust tube carries most of the subsystems,                                               
including the mechanically despun, high-gain antenna, two hydrazine fuel tanks, the                                               
thrusters, and the experiment sensors (Fig. 15). A star scanner and a nutation damper                                             
are attached to the thrust tube.                                                                                                  
  Planet-A and MS-TS weigh 139.5 kg and 138.1 kg, respectively, including 10 kg                                                   
of hydrazine propellant in each case. Both spacecraft are spin-stabilized, with the                                               
facility to change the spin rate (see Section 5). The spin axes of both spacecraft will                                           
be kept perpendicular to the ecliptic plane.                                                                                      
  The spin-rate of Planet-A will be changed quite frequently. It must be reduced, for                                             
example, to 0.2 rpm during the UVI imaging operating using an onboard momentum                                                    
wheel, while during communication periods and during solar-wind measurements a                                                    
spin-rate of 6.3 rpm is preferable.                                                                                               
  The spacecraft/Earth geometry and the data-rate requirements preclude the use of                                                
a single antenna for the duration of the mission. The antenna subsystem therefore                                                 
consists of a high-gain antenna, a medium-gain antenna as a backup, and a low-gain                                                
antenna for near-Earth operation. The despun high-gain antenna has an offset-                                                     
parabolic reflector with a diameter of 80 cm and a gain of 21.5 dB in uplink and                                                  
22.5 dB in downlink transmission. The communications subsystem operates in S-band                                                 
using a 5 W transmitter.                                                                                                          
  Planet-A has two data formats: Format-1 provides Ultra-Violet Imager (UVI) data.                                                
Format-2 Solar-Wind Experiment (ESP) data (Table 6). MS-T5 has four data formats                                                  
(Table 7). The data rates of both spacecraft are 2048 bit/s (without coding) in 'high                                             
bit rate' and 64 bit/s (with convolutional coding) in 'low bit rate' mode. The bit rate                                           
used will depend on the communication distance.                                                                                   
  The ground station for the mission has been built at Usuda, about 170 km northwest                                              
of Tokyo. The station's 64 m diameter dish antenna has a gain of approximately 63 dB                                              
(Fig. 16). A 64 bit/s communication link (convolutionally encoded PCM) is expected                                                
to be possible from 1.1 AU, which will be the comet-Earth distance during the

  Planet-A and MS-T5 were launched separately by M-3SII launchers (Fig. 17). The                                                  
M-3SII launcher is a new three-stage solid-propellant rocket with a solid kick-stage                                              
motor attached. Both spacecraft were injected directly into a heliocentric comet                                                  
transfer trajectory. Immediately after launch, each spacecraft was tracked for about                                              
8 h per day. They were then despun from 120 rpm, to about 30 rpm, using the thruster                                              
subsystem. The spacecraft's attitude was initially automatically adjusted such that its                                           
spin axis was perpendicular to the Sun-spacecraft line. During the subsequent ground                                              
contact, the spin rate was further reduced to 6.3 rpm and the spin axis reoriented                                                
to be perpendicular to the ecliptic plane. After the first 4-5 d of ranging and accurate                                          
orbit determination, a mid-course correction manoeuvre was carried out. During the                                                
interplanetary cruise, attitude maintenance operations will have to be performed at                                               
1Od intervals.                                                                                                                    
  Both spacecraft will make their closest approach to Halley near the time of the                                                 
comet's post-perihelion crossing of the ecliptic plane (Fig. 18).                                                                 
  The Planet-A spacecraft will be targeted to pass Halley's nucleus on the sunward                                                
side at a distance of 150000 km on 8 March 1986. Solar-wind measurements will be                                                  
carried out continuously on Planet-A during the cruise, except during the periods of                                              
UVI imaging, and this spacecraft will be in contact with the ground station for 7-8 h                                             
per day. In this period, during which the spacecraft will be spinning at 6.3 rpm, its                                             
bubble memory will be read out, solar-wind measurements made, and commands                                                        
received from the ground. During the remaining 15 h per day the spacecraft will be                                                
spinning at 0.2 rpm and taking images. It takes 5 - 10 min to spin-down and 30 min                                                
to spin-up the spacecraft. During the 15 h, six images can be taken, spaced in time,                                              
to fill the 1 Mbit bubble memory. At large distances from the Earth, data can be                                                  
transmitted from the spacecraft at a rate of 64 bit/s. In this mode, each memory read-                                            
out will require about 4 h.

 Imaging is planned to start in early November 1985, when Halley crosses the                                                      
ecliptic plane at a heliocentric distance of 0.85 AU. An attempt will be made to find

and MS-T5                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                  
the comet with the camera as soon as possible, despite the large distance from the                                                
spacecraft. Imaging will continue at least until mid-April 1986,  when the hydrogen                                               
corona will no longer be detectable. Halley will then be at a heliocentric distance of                                            
1.39 AU and at the same time will be reaching its closest distance to Earth of                                                    
0.42 AU. During Planet-A's journey to Halley, an attempt may also be made to image                                                
the corona of Giacobini-Zinner if this comet's hydrogen production rate is high                                                   
enough.                                                                                                                           
  The MS-T5 spacecraft will be targeted to pass within 7 million kilometres of Comet                                              
Halley on 11 March 1986. About one month of this test spacecraft's initial cruise                                                 
phase will be used for technical tests, including the operation of the new 64 m deep-                                             
space station at Usuda. Later, its three scientific instruments will study the solar-wind                                         
plasma and, if possible, detect the signatures of the solar-wind/comet interaction.                                               
When the other spacecraft make their closest approach to Halley, MS-T5 will be used                                               
to make complementary solar-wind measurements.
