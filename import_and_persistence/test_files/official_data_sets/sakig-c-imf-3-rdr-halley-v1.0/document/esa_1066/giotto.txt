  ESA's Giotto Mission to Halley's Comet is a fast flyby at 00 UT on 14 March 1986,                                               
about four weeks after the comet's perihelion passage, when it will have been at its                                              
most active. The scientific payload is made up of ten experiments with a total mass                                               
of approximately 60 kg: a camera for imaging the comet nucleus, three mass spec-                                                  
trometers for analyzing the elemental and isotopic composition of the cometary dust                                               
and gas environment, various dust impact detectors, a photopolarimeter for measuring                                              
the coma's brightness, and a set of plasma instruments for studying the solar-                                                    
wind/comet interaction. In view of the high flyby velocity of 68 km/s, the active ex-                                             
periment time will only be very short - of the order of 4 h - and all data are to be                                              
transmitted back to Earth in real time, at a rate of 40 kbit/s.                                                                   
  The Giotto spacecraft is spin-stabilized and has a despun, high-gain parabolic dish                                             
antenna inclined at 44.3deg which will point towards Earth during the cometary en-                                                
counter. A specially designed 'bumper shield' protects the front end of the spacecraft                                            
from being destroyed by hyper-velocity dust impacts.                                                                              
  The Giotto spacecraft will be targetted to pass the nucleus at a distance of 500 km                                             
on the sunward side.                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                  
1. Introduction                                                                                                                   
  The Giotto project was approved in July 1980, allowing precisely five years between                                             
approval and launch. During the Giotto mission study phase, a Scientific Working                                                  
Group formulated the scientific objectives and defined a mission concept and a model                                              
payload. The scientific objectives for the Giotto mission are:                                                                    
-   to ascertain the elemental and isotopic composition of the volatile components in                                             
    the cometary coma, in particular to identify the parent molecules                                                             
-   to characterize the physical processes and chemical reactions that occur in the                                               
    cometary atmosphere and ionosphere                                                                                            
-   to determine the elemental and isotopic composition of the cometary dust particles                                            
-   to measure the total gas production rate and the dust flux and size/mass distribu-                                            
    tion and to derive the dust-to-gas ratio                                                                                      
-   to investigate the macroscopic system of plasma flows resulting from the interac-                                             
    tion between the cometary and the solar-wind plasma                                                                           
-   to provide numerous images of the comet nucleus with a resolution down to                                                     
    50 m, thereby allowing the nucleus' size and rotation to be deduced and its mass                                              
    to be estimated.                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                  
To accomplish these objectives, the Giotto spacecraft carries ten scientific                                                      
experiments, selected in January 1981, some of which have more than one sensor.                                                   
They are listed in Table 1 together with their mass, power and data-rate allocations.

plement to the Giotto mission.                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                  
2. The scientific payload                                                                                                         
2.1 The Halley Multicolour Camera (HMC)                                                                                           
  The camera is designed to detect and image the nucleus of Comet Halley, to measure                                              
the nucleus' size, shape and albedo, and to observe its active sublimation process. By                                            
following the moving comet nucleus, the camera's microcomputers can determine the                                                 
spacecraft's trajectory parameters relative to the nucleus in real time.                                                          
  The optical system of the camera is a modified Ritchey-Chretien design with correc-                                             
ting field lens (Fig. 1). The telescope is mounted behind the spacecraft bumper shield                                            
and therefore protected from direct dust-particle impacts. A 45deg deflecting mirror is                                           
used to look at the comet. A baffle ensures adequate reduction of diffuse sunlight and                                            
spacecraft-reflected light.                                                                                                       
  The telescope images onto a focal-plane arrangement of one reticon and two area                                                 
CCDs (Charge-Coupled Devices). The reticon is used to detect the nucleus and later                                                
to clock the two area CCDs. The area CCDs are used in a mode in which only a few                                                  
active lines scan the image of the comet during its apparent motion across the rotating                                           
(because of the spacecraft spin) field of view; the remaining lines are masked and used                                           
as a low-powerù highly efficient data buffer. The contents of the exposed lines are                                               
shifted into the masked CCD lines at precisely the same rate as the nucleus image                                                 
moves. Using CCDs as the intermediate storage for a line scanner allows exposure                                                  
times as short as 10 micro s to be used. Smear due to the spinning motion of the camera                                           
is then negligible, even for the detector's high resolution of 22 microrad per pixel. In the                                      
nucleus-imaging mode, the camera works best if the nucleus is slightly (>~ 1deg) off spin                                         
axis. The two area CCDs each have two segments, three of the four segments being                                                  
tinted to provide colour pictures.

  As the spacecraft flies through the cometary coma, cometary neutrals will be en-                                                
countered at the flyby velocity of 68 km/s. Since the gas outflow velocity is much                                                
smaller (<1 km/s), one might think that the mass of the cometary neutrals could be                                                
determined simply by measuring their energy (since E= 1/2 mv**2). However, the                                                    
daughter molecules can derive significant kinetic energies from energetic interactions                                            
such as photo-dissociation and ion-molecular reactions, which appear either as a                                                  
change in the incident direction, or as an increase or decrease in energy, e.g. an oxygen                                         
atom with a velocity of 5 km/s can appear anywhere between mass 14 and 18. Conse-                                                 
quently, an energy spectrum will be smeared, predominantly in the lower mass ranges,                                              
and individual peaks corresponding to particular masses cannot be resolved. In the                                                
higher mass ranges, the cometary neutral velocity distribution will be 'cold' and the                                             
energy spectrum will correspond to the mass spectrum.                                                                             
  In the lower mass range (1-36 amu), therefore, a double-focusing (angle and                                                     
energy) mass spectrometer is used consisting of a parallel-plate electrostatic energy                                             
analyzer followed by a magnetic sector field momentum analyzer. The particle beam                                                 
is imaged onto a microchannel plate with linear readout, where each position cor-                                                 
responds to a particular mass. The energy information that is lost in the 'M-analyzer'                                            
is provided by the ''E-analyzer', which is simply a parallel-plate electrostatic analyzer                                         
with single focusing (angle) properties. Again, the particle beam is imaged onto a                                                
microchannel plate with linear readout, where each position corresponds to a par-                                                 
ticular energy. For analysis, the beam of cometary neutrals has first to be transformed                                           
into a beam of ions; this is achieved by bombardment with an electron beam, with the                                              
electrons being emitted from either of two redundant filaments.                                                                   
  Both sensors (Figs.2a,b) have separate and nearly identical gas inlet systems with                                              
an electron beam ion source of fly-through geometry. The ion source operates in two                                               
modes. In the neutral mode, cometary ions are reflected by deflecting plates in front                                             
of the entrance slit; in the ion mode, the deflecting plates are switched off and the elec-                                       
tron emission is suppressed, allowing cometary ions to enter the analyzer. Further                                                
away from the comet nucleus, the instrument will measure predominantly ions, close                                                
to the nucleus predominantly neutrals.

2.3 The Ion Mass Spectrometer (IMS)                                                                                               
  The Ion Mass Spectrometer is made up of two sensors, a High-Energy Range Spec-                                                  
trometer (HERS) optimized for measurements in the outer coma where a turbulent                                                    
transition between solar wind and cometary ions is expected, and a High-Intensity                                                 
Spectrometer (HIS) optimized for measurements in the inner coma where high fluxes                                                 
of relatively cold cometary ions are anticipated.                                                                                 
  The HERS sensor (Fig. 3) consists basically of an electrostatic mirror to deflect the                                           
cometary ions into the instrument, a pair of grids with variable applied voltage, a sec-                                          
tor magnet which serves as momentum-per-charge filter, and an electrostatic deflector                                             
which spreads the momentum-analyzed ions according to their energy per charge. The                                                
beam is then imaged onto a two-dimensional microchannel plate, with one dimension                                                 
a measure of mass-per-charge, and the other a measure of the elevation angle of the                                               
ion's velocity vector. Azimuth angle is scanned via the spacecraft's spin and the                                                 
energy distribution is determined by variation of the voltages applied to the pair of                                             
grids.                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                  
 The HIS sensor (Fig. 4) employs two quadrispherical electrostatic analyzers with                                                 
magnetic deflection and an array of 4 X4 channeltrons as detectors. The energy-per-                                               
charge of the particles to be analyzed is selected by the differential voltage applied to                                         
the first electrostatic analyzer, while the momentum-per-charge (and thus mass-per-                                               
charge) is determined by the acceleration potential applied between a pair of plane                                               
parallel grids located behind the exit of that analyzer. The ion species expected at the                                          
selected energy is imaged at the centre of the one-dimensional detector array of four                                             
channeltrons. Hence, the mass spectrum and the temperatures of all individual species                                             
can be measured by just scanning through the energy-per-charge range. The other                                                   
direction of the channeltron array provides resolution in elevation, while azimuth                                                
angle is scanned by the spacecraft spin.

2.4 The Dust Mass Spectrometer (PIA)                                                                                              
  This instrument measures the chemical and isotopic composition of individual dust                                               
particles (Fig. 5). When a dust particle impacts on the instrument's target, a plasma                                             
is generated, from which ions are extracted and accelerated via a 1.5 kV acceleration                                             
grid. The accelerated ions pass through a time-of-flight tube approximately 1 m long,                                             
where they are separated in time according to their mass. The spectrum of elements                                                
of which the dust particle is composed is recorded by an electron multiplier at the end                                           
of the drift path. Since the elemental abundances of typical minerals found in                                                    
meteorites vary significantly, it is possible to identify the predominant mineral in the                                          
impacting dust grain from the quantitative abundance in the spectrum.

  Impact-ionization mass spectrometry is ideally suited for a fast cometary flyby such                                            
as Giotto will make, because the number of positive ions released upon impact in-                                                 
creases significantly with the impact velocity. The time-of-flight tube actually consists                                         
of two tubes at an angle of 8 deg, with an ion reflector in between, used for energy focus-                                       
ing. This, together with the high ion yield, gives excellent mass resolution, so that                                             
isotopic ratios such as 7Li/6Li, 11B/10B, and 13C/12C can be resolved. Because of its

predominantly analyze the most common dust particles, which are expected to be in

2.5 The Dust Impact Detector System (DID)                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                  
  Although larger dust particles are more infrequent, the bulk of the mass released                                               
from the nucleus in the form of solids is contained in them. Impacts of these large dust                                          
particles on the front sheet of the spacecraft bumper shield (Fig. 6) are detected by                                             
three piezo-electric elements (microphones) mounted 120deg apart at the outer edge of                                             
the front sheet (meteoroid shield momentum measurement, MSM). They register the                                                   
shock wave that is generated by each dust-particle impact and propagates through the                                              
front sheet. In this way, the whole front-sheet area (2 m**2) can be used as a 'detec-                                            
tor'. A similar element on the rear sheet (rear-shield momentum measurement, RSM)                                                 
measures the mass of the even larger dust particles that are able to penetrate the front                                          
sheet (>10**-6 g) and impact on this rear sheet.                                                                                  
  A Capacitor Impact Sensor (CIS) 1000 cm**2 in area measures the flux of dust par-                                               
ticles > 10**-10  g penetrating a thin (70 micro m) mylar dielectric material. Aluminium                                          
deposits on both faces act as a capacitor. When impacted by a sufficiently large parti-                                           
cle, the dielectric of the capacitor will be perforated and the device discharged through                                         
the impact-generated plasma. The counting rate is limited by the capacitor recharging                                             
process to ~ 1000 impacts/s.                                                                                                      
  Very small dust particles are to be detected by an Impact Plasma Detector (IPM),                                                
which has very high count-rate capability. This sensor is also located on the front sheet                                         
of the spacecraft bumper shield. The impact-generated plasma electrons and ions are                                               
separated by an electric field, the total charge being proportional to the particle mass.                                         
The impact plasma detector has two arrays, one without a foil, the other covered by                                               
a metalized penetration film 1 micron thick, which observes a somewhat reduced                                                    
number of impacts depending on the penetrating power or bulk density of the dust par-                                             
ticles. A piezo-electric microphone sensor (as in MSM) forms part of the IPM and                                                  
simultaneously detects the impact momentum, independent of the ambient plasma. The                                                
impact momentum differs depending on whether the dust particle impacts on the                                                     
covered (momentum of the debris cloud) or uncovered (momentum of dust particle on-                                                
ly) part of the IPM. Furthermore, a thin metallic probe with a - 20 V potential, in-                                              
sulated from the spacecraft structure, forms part of the impact plasma detector and                                               
monitors the saturation current of the secondary electrons emitted by impacts of com-                                             
etary gas and dust particles. The response of this sensor will be used to assess the den-                                         
sity of the plasma cloud that forms around the spacecraft during its critical passage                                             
through the inner coma.

2.6 The Fast Ion Sensor (FIS)                                                                                                     
  This sensor (Fig. 7) measures the three-dimensional velocity distributions of solar-                                            
wind ions, giving their flow speed and direction, temperature and density, and follows                                            
the development of the solar wind as it is thermalized, slowed-down and deflected.                                                
Ions streaming parallel to the relative-velocity vector will not be measured, as these                                            
are expected to have very high fluxes near the comet.                                                                             
  The sensor consists of a hemispherical plate electrostatic energy analyzer, with a                                              
subsequent quadrispherical sector (80deg) to disperse the trajectories according to the                                           
polar angle of incidence before they are registered by a microchannel plate with a                                                
series of eight metal anodes behind it. The energy band can be varied by changing the                                             
voltages on the plates of the energy analyzer.                                                                                    
 The experiment can be operated in different modes, depending on the angular width                                                
and the energy spread of the ion distribution.                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                  
2.7 The Implanted Ion Sensor (IIS)                                                                                                
  Some cometary neutrals may reach large distances from the nucleus before they are                                               
ionized and become 'implanted' in the solar wind. The task of the Implanted Ion Sen-                                              
sor (Fig. 8) is to search for these cometary ions. It combines an elecrostatic analyzer                                           
with a time-of-flight measurement. The quadrispherical electrostatic analyzer selects                                             
positive ions of a given energy per charge (E/Q), which are then accelerated by a                                                 
potential difference V before the time T to travel a path length D is determined. By                                              
measuring these quantities, the mass-to-charge ratio can be determined from                                                       
                                                                                                                                  
  M/Q = 2(V + (E/Q)) T**2/D**2                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                  
Figure 7. The Fast Ion Sensor (FIS)                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                  
Since cometary neutrals are ionized by charge exchange or photons, the charge state                                               
is predominantly Q= 1, allowing the ion mass to be determined.                                                                    
  The instrument has a total of five electrostatic analyzers, each followed by a time-of-                                         
flight tube. The ions enter one of the electrostatic analyzers, depending on their inci-                                          
dent elevation angle. As the ions leave the analyzer, they are accelerated before they                                            
enter the time-of-flight tube, which is only 4 cm long. The 'start' signal is provided                                            
by secondary electrons generated by the ion's passage through a thin carbon foil, the                                             
'stop' signal by secondary electrons generated in the surface layer of a spherically-                                             
shaped aluminium absorber. In both cases, the secondary electrons are accelerated by                                              
0.7 kV and deflected towards a microchannel plate. In the '4D' mode, the ions are                                                 
sorted into five different mass groups in the range 1-45 amu; in the 'TOF' mode,                                                  
they are sorted into 256 groups, depending on their time-of-flight.

2.8 The Electron Electrostatic Analyzer (EESA)                                                                                    
  This sensor (Fig. 9) measures the pitch-angle distributions of suprathermal electrons                                           
in the energy range 10 eV - 30 keV. These measurements, together with those of                                                    
the FIS, will define the solar-wind plasma and its interaction with the comet. EESA                                               
is an electrostatic analyzer which is hemispherical in shape, but has the characteristics                                         
of a quadrispherical analyzer. The particles enter through a circular opening in the                                              
centre of the hemisphere and are deflected through 90deg before they are detected by                                              
one of the 17 sections of a ring-shaped microchannel plate, depending on their incident                                           
polar angle.  Azimuthal resolution is provided by the spacecraft's spin.  The potential                                           
between the analyzer plates is varied in 39 steps, providing a 10% energy resolution.

  This sensor (Fig. 10) is intended for operation in the innermost part of the coma,                                              
where the cometary ions are expected to be singly charged and to have negligible ther-                                            
mal velocities.  In the spacecraft frame of reference, these particles will flow strictly                                         
radially towards the spacecraft with a velocity of 68.4 km/s, and their kinetic energy                                            
will range from 245 eV (10 amu) to 4.9 keV (200 amu).  As the energy E and the                                                    
charge Q of the ions are assumed to be known, an E/Q measurement translates directly                                              
into a mass measurement.  Of particular interest are the clathrate hydrates (e.g.                                                 
CO.6H2O), which are formed when some of the more volatile species such as CO,                                                     
CO2, NH3, are trapped in a cage of H2O molecules.  Once these clusters are ionized                                                
(I+.(H2O)m), PICCA has the ability to detect them because of its high mass range.                                                 
  PICCA is a hemispherical electrostatic analyzer with two channeltrons as detecting                                              
devices.  By varying the potential between the top and bottom parts of the aperture,                                              
the particles will be deflected from the general flow direction and will enter the                                                
analyzer according to their mass.  To obtain a good and constant mass resolution, the                                             
ions are decelerated before entering the electrostatic analyzer.  The hemispherical                                               
analyzer itself is operated at two different fixed voltages,  corresponding to two mass                                           
ranges.

2.10 The Energetic Particles Experiment (EPA)                                                                                     
  The prime purpose of the Energetic Particles Experiment (Fig. 11) is to extend the                                              
range of the Giotto plasma analyzers to higher energies. It will detect particles which                                           
are accelerated in the cometary environment from solar-wind energies (~ 1 keV), and                                               
it will allow determination of the dust-column density as the low-energy solar particles                                          
are absorbed by the dust. Monitoring of the energetic-solar-particle flux will also pro-                                          
vide useful background information, in particular during a solar flare, to instruments                                            
using devices which are sensitive to these particles, such as channeltrons, channel                                               
plates and CCDs.                                                                                                                  
  This experiment consists of three identical very small telescopes, each with two                                                
solid-state detectors. Two telescopes are mounted side-by-side at 45deg, and a third one                                          
at 135deg to the relative velocity vector. This allows observations of field-aligned parti-                                       
cle streaming for all inclinations of the magnetic-field vector; in other words, together                                         
with the spacecraft spin, it allows three-dimensional viewing of particle pitch-angle                                             
distributions. One of the two adjacent telescopes is covered by a thin foil, the other                                            
is open. Low-energy protons cannot penetrate the foil and therefore the covered                                                   
telescope measures only electrons, while the open telescope measures both protons                                                 
and electrons. Neglecting statistical fluctuations, the count-rate difference then applies                                        
to protons only.                                                                                                                  
  The energy of the incoming charged particle is determined by measuring its energy

Particles of different species and energy ranges are identified using the dE/dx versus                                            
E technique. The low energy threshold of 20 keV is essentially determined by the                                                  
detector noise. It coincides with the upper energy threshold of the Fast Ion Sensor                                               
(20 keV).                                                                                                                         
  During the encounter phase, spectral and angular information about particle fluxes                                              
will be provided with high time resolution (0.5 s). During the cruise phase, approx-                                              
imately 30 min average particle-flux measurements and angular information will                                                    
generally be obtained in one energy channel. An experiment internal memory of 64

2.11 The Magnetometer (MAG)                                                                                                       
  The magnetic field is to be measured by a wide-range (0.004-65536 nT) triaxial                                                  
ring-core fluxgate magnetometer mounted on the antenna tripod, where it is furthest                                               
from the spacecraft and also protected from dust impacts (Fig. 15). The Giotto                                                    
magnetometer is identical to the GSFC fluxgate magnetometers carried on Voyager                                                   
and destined for flight on ESA's Ulysses (formerly ISPM) spacecraft. Noise                                                        
characteristics have been improved by use of different sensor core alloys.                                                        
  The principle of the fluxgate magnetometer is as follows (Fig. 12). Suppose that in                                             
the simplest sensor arrangement a ferromagnetic core of soft magnetic material is                                                 
periodically driven into saturation by a drive coil generating a periodic magnetic field                                          
strength of suitable wave shape at the drive frequence f(0). An additional sense coil                                             
around the core will then exhibit a distorted signal composed of frequency components                                             
at f(0) and odd harmonics. Addition of an ambient magnetic-field component along the                                              
core axis will lead to the appearance of even harmonics. Generally, in fluxgate                                                   
magnetometers the second harmonic is detected because its amplitude turns out to be                                               
proportional to the ambient field component parallel to the core or the sense-coil axis.                                          
To obtain good linearity, a feedback coil is generally added to compensate the ambient                                            
magnetic field in response to the output from the sense coil. In this case, the sense                                             
coil is essentially used for zero detection only.                                                                                 
  The measurement of the ambient magnetic field is disturbed by the spacecraft field,                                             
which generally has two sources: perm fields and induced fields due to magnetic                                                   
materials, and stray fields due to varying electric currents. Because of their potential                                          
lack of stability, magnetically soft materials are particularly disturbing for magnetic                                           
measurements. The same is true for stray fields. Major sources of contamination are:                                              
the antenna despin motor, the NMS and IMS experiment magnets, the three HMC                                                       
motors and the PIA motor, the HMC invar, the antenna feed, the TWTs and the lat-                                                  
ching relays. Present estimates indicate a combined experiment/spacecraft field                                                   
strength of ~ 30 nT, with ~ 10% variability at the location of the outer sensor.                                                  
  The magnetometer has two sensors, an outboard sensor located about 1.1 m above                                                  
the upper face of the spacecraft body, and an inboard sensor located about 0.5 m above                                            
it. From the difference in the readings of the two sensors, the spacecraft field can be                                           
estimated and its contaminating effect on the ambient field can be eliminated to some                                             
extent. The outboard sensor is triaxial (three orthogonal sensors for the measurement                                             
of the three components of the ambient magnetic field vector), while the inboard sen-

  Observations of cosmic dust have traditionally been classified as either 'remote'                                               
(essentially optical) or 'in-situ' (mass spectrometers or impact detectors). Optical                                              
remote sensing results in a column brightness (integration over the line of sight), inter-                                        
pretation of which is impossible without assumptions about both the spatial distribution                                          
of the dust grains and their scattering properties. In a cometary flyby, a third type of                                          
observation, in-situ photopolarimeter observation - referred to as 'optical probing'                                              
- is possible. For a photopolarimeter aimed tangentially to the spacecraft orbit, in-                                             
version of the brightness integral is rigorous and provides (without any assumptions),                                            
in-situ observation of the local spatial density of dust and gas and of the scattering pro-                                       
perties of dust grains.                                                                                                           
  The requirement to observe tangentially offers two possibilities: forward or rear-                                              
ward, corresponding to phase angles of 72.8deg and 107.2deg. Because of the less critical                                         
engineering demands (smaller baffle, no dust-particle impacts), a rearward-looking in-                                            
strument was chosen (Fig. 13).                                                                                                    
  The photopolarimeter utilizes a small refracting photometer with an objective lens                                              
of 24 mm diameter (18 mm effective), eight interference filters, two spectrally mat-                                              
ching polaroid foils, and a microchannel plate for spectral analysis. The rotation of                                             
the analyzers needed to determine the polarization is provided by the spin of the                                                 
spacecraft. One complete polarization measurement is performed during half a                                                      
spacecraft spin. The difference between successive line-of-sight measurements refers                                              
to the brightness and polarization of a small volume of space only (a 'cylinder' about                                            
140 km in length and 7 km, corresponding to the instrument's 3deg field of view, in                                               
diameter).                                                                                                                        
  The dust will be observed in four spectral bands which are free or almost free of                                               
gaseous emissions. Simultaneously, the discrete gaseous emissions of OH, CN, CO+                                                  
and C2 will be monitored.

  It is estimated that the cometary electron content is ~ 3 X 10**16 m**-2, while the in-                                         
terplanetary electron content is ~ 10**18  m**-2 , and the electron content in the Earth's                                        
ionosphere is ~ 10**17 m**-2 . Evidently, the electron content of the comet is only a frac-                                       
tion of the total electron content. Therefore, the cometary electron content as                                                   
measured during the encounter will appear as a small time variation of 10-15 min                                                  
duration superimposed on the total background content, which is relatively constant

tions, wave-like fluctuations, solar-flare effects). It is therefore necessary to monitor                                         
the ionospheric electron content during the comet encounter.

nominally at 15 rpm. During the comet encounter the spin axis will be aligned with

the various mid-course attitude and orbit-correction manoeuvres.                                                                  
 The particular comet environment, in combination with the high flyby velocity,                                                   
leads to problems never before encountered on space flights. Dust particles with                                                  
masses ~ 10**-6 g impacting at 68 km/s could easily penetrate the spacecraft structure.                                           
Each time, a cloud of debris would be formed inside the spacecraft and impact with                                                
high velocity on experiments and spacecraft components, leading to their destruction.                                             
To provide protection against dust particles of up to 0.1 g, a single sheet of aluminium                                          
would have to be more than 8 cm thick and would then weigh more than 600 kg, which                                                
is prohibitive. An ideal and in fact the only solution to the problem is a 'dual-sheet                                            
bumper shield', consisting ofa thin front sheet and a thick rear sheet with a large space                                         
between. Upon impact on the thin front sheet, dust particle will be completely vaporiz-                                           
ed. The vapour cloud then expands into the empty space between the two sheets and                                                 
impacts on the rear sheet, where its energy is dissipated by distributing it over large                                           
area.                                                                                                                             
 The thin front sheet and thick rear sheet are in fact 23 cm apart (Table 10). Two                                                
quadrispherical shell sectors were closed over the kick-motor nozzle after firing to                                              
complete the bumper shield's front sheet (Fig. 16).

  The spacecraft has three equipment platforms, from top to bottom (Fig. 14): the 'up-                                            
per' and the 'lower' platforms carrying Spacecraft equipment boxes, and the 'experi-                                              
ment' platform mounted on top of the rear bumper shield (with a small separation)                                                 
The sensors of the Dust-Impact Detector (DID) System are mounted on the front                                                     
bumper shield, the Magnetometer Sensors (MAG) are mounted on the carbon-fibre                                                     
tripod as far away from the Spacecaft's magnetic-field sources as possible, and the Op-                                           
tical Probe Experiment (OPE) is mounted on the upper platform inside the spacecraft,                                              
looking rearward. All other experiment Sensors and electronics' boxes are mounted on                                              
the experiment platform (camera shown as example). The experiment Sensors protrude                                                
up to 17 cm from the Spacecraft side wall to allow measurements in the undisturbed                                                
flow of cometary particles (Fig. 15).                                                                                             
  The solar-cell array will provide 190 W of power during the encounter, which is                                                 
not quite sufficient when one of the two redundant X-band travelling-wave-tube                                                    
amplifiers (TWTs) (70 W), all other spacecraft subsystems (85 W), and all ex-                                                     
periments (51 W) are switched on. Batteries are required in addition to the solar cells                                           
not only to bridge this gap, but also to provide full power during the last part of the                                           
encounter, in case the solar array's power output deteriorates due to dust-particle                                               
impacts.                                                                                                                          
  The main spacecraft antenna is a High-Gain Antenna (HGA) dish with an effective                                                 
reflector diameter of 1.47 m. The HGA can be operated in either S-band (2.1 GHz                                                   
uplink, 2.3 GHz downlink) or X-band (8.4 GHz downlink). The HGA beam is inclin-                                                   
ed 44.3deg with respect to the spacecraft's spin axis and the antenna itself is despun so                                         
that it points permanently at the Earth during the encounter. The X-band link budget                                              
shows that 40 kbit/s of scientific data can be acquired during the encounter, including                                           
a 5 dB weather margin (rain at the receiving station). The pointing requirements in                                               
X-band are rather stringent: if the spacecraft spin axis is not well aligned with the                                             
spacecraft relative-velocity vector, or if the spacecraft attitude changes due to the im-                                         
pact of a large dust particle, the telemetry link to the ground receiving station may                                             
be lost (antenna gain decreases by 3 dB for 0.8deg misalignment in X-band and 3deg in                                             
S-band). For operations in the geostationary transfer orbit and near Earth, two low-                                              
gain antennas operating at S-band have been used. They are located at either end of                                               
the spacecraft: a cardioid antenna at the upper end of the hollow carbon-fibre tripod                                             
and a fill-in antenna (microstrip patch) flush-mounted on the front bumper shield.                                                
  A MAGE-1 SB solid-propellant motor is mounted centrally. It carried 374 kg of                                                   
propellant, giving the velocity increment delta V = 1400 m/s needed to inject the

branches is used. Each branch is made up of four catalytic hydrazine thrusters. 69 kg                                             
of hydrazine is available, providing a total delta V capability of the order of 170 m/s, of                                       
which some 150 m/s still remained per 1 February 1986. Three types of sensors are                                                 
used for attitude determination: an Earth Elevation Sensor consisting of two infrared                                             
pencil-beam telescopes, a Sun Sensor consisting of two detector units, and a Star Map-                                            
per with a 9deg x9deg field of view and a selectable threshold down to +2.4 silicon                                               
magnitude.                                                                                                                        
  The Giotto thermal design makes use of both active and passive techniques. The                                                  
passive means are radiators under the high-gain antenna and between the main and the                                              
experiment platform using Optical Surface Reflectors, and Multi-Layer Insulation                                                  
blankets covering the space between the solar-cell array and the experiment platform.                                             
The active means are heaters which can be activated by ground command or by                                                       
dedicated onboard software, three identical shutters (variable-area radiators), which                                             
can also be activated by ground command, 12 diode boards which use some of the

  The Giotto mission is a fast flyby of Comet Halley around midnight UT on 13 March                                               
1986, near the comet's post-perihelion crossing of the ecliptic plane, about 1 month                                              
after its perihelion passage. At this time, the comet will be at its most active. A pre-                                          
perihelion encounter was also considered at an early stage, but was not further pur-                                              
sued, primarily because the launch energy needed would have been much higher,                                                     
which for a given launcher would have imposed a severe limitation on the mass of the                                              
scientific payload that could be launched.                                                                                        
 After five years of development and testing, Giotto was launched on 2 July 1985                                                  
by an Ariane-1 rocket from Kourou, French Guyana. The spacecraft was initially in-                                                
jected into a Geostationary Transfer Orbit (perigee: 198.5 km, apogee: 36000 km,                                                  
inclination 7deg). After three revolutions in this orbit, the onboard boost motor was fired                                       
near perigee to inject Giotto into a heliocentric orbit. The high-gain antenna was                                                
despun three days later.                                                                                                          
  The camera was switched on in Format 3 on 10 August 1985 to monitor the declam-                                                 
ping of its barrel, followed by the Magnetometer Experiment and Energetic Particles                                               
Experiment switch-on on 22 August. These two experiments have remained on ever                                                    
since, using their memories to bridge gaps in ground-station coverage. The complete                                               
switch-on/pyro firing sequence is shown in Table 11. All experiment functional tests                                              
have already been performed successfully.                                                                                         
  During its cruise phase, the Giotto spacecraft is being controlled by a number of                                               
ground stations distributed around the globe. Depending on their size and equipment,                                              
these ground stations are used for different purposes and different mission phases                                                
(Table 12). ESA's station at Carnarvon is the prime station for spacecraft commanding                                             
throughout the entire mission. Format-3 data can be received by Carnavon until mid-                                               
January, and by Weilheim until mid-February. The NASA 34 m Deep-Space Network                                                     
(Goldstone, Madrid & Canberra) is being used in addition for spacecraft ranging dur-                                              
ing the cruise phase.                                                                                                             
  Throughout the mission, the spacecraft attitude defined by the Sun Aspect Angle                                                 
(SAA) (0deg = Sun above the tripod) must be kept inside an allowed corridor (Fig. 17),                                            
which is defined by two constraints: the high-gain antenna must point permanently at                                              
the Earth to maintain the telecommunications link, and the spacecraft must generate                                               
enough power without being heated up too much (thermal/power constraint). The                                                     
hotest phase of the mission occurred at the end of December 1985, when Giotto was                                                 
only 0.72 AU away from the Sun.

encounter with Halley on 14 March 1986.                                                                                           
Halley's orbit is retrograde and inclined at 18deg                                                                                
with respect to the ecliptic                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                  
  In the event that the telecommunications link to the Earth is lost, the spacecraft will                                         
drift slowly out of the allowed corridor. If, however, its attitude is kept within a cer-                                         
tain narrow part of the allowed corridor, its boundaries given by the 'sheared con-

counter on 13/14 March 1986. Giotto's orbit lies in the ecliptic. Halley's retrograde                                             
orbit is also shown, its plane being inclined by 18deg with respect to the ecliptic. After                                        
a cruise phase of eight months, Giotto will encounter Halley's Comet at OO UT on                                                  
14 March 1986. The phase angle to the Sun will be 107.2deg (Fig. 19), i.e. the                                                    
spacecraft will approach the comet nucleus from 'behind', which is favourable for

ward hemisphere. The flyby velocity will be 68.4 km/s. The main experiment switch-                                                
on will start, about two days before the encounter, and finish no later than 4 hours                                              
before t(0), the time of closest approach.

experiments will be switched off during periods of thruster firing, which can last                                                
several hours and are planned for 10, 11 and possibly also 12 March (Table 14).                                                   
  Short manoeuvres (several minutes) are needed to correct the spacecraft's attitude                                              
and long-duration manoeuvres are needed to correct its trajectory and target it to the                                            
preselected point. Giotto's attitude will be such that the spacecraft spin axis will be                                           
precisely aligned with the relative velocity vector so that no dust particles can impact                                          
on the unprotected sides of the spacecraft. Giotto will be targeted to pass the nucleus                                           
on the sunward side in order to obtain images of the nucleus day side. The desired                                                
flyby distance of 500 km has been adopted as a compromise between the partially con-                                              
flicting requirements of three groups of experiments. One experiment group (HMC)                                                  
would like to fly by at 1000 km, but no closer than 500 km; a second group (OPE),                                                 
MAG, NMS, IMS, GRE) would like to fly by the nucleus as close as possible, even                                                   
if the spacecraft would not survive; while a third group (PIA, DID, EPA, JPA, RPA)                                                
would also like to fly by as close as possible whilst still maintaining a high survival                                           
probability.                                                                                                                      
  Targeting the spacecraft to this preselected point is a difficult task as the nucleus                                           
is too small to be observed from the Earth even by the largest telescopes and moreover                                            
is disguised by the coma dust and gas. Also, due to the asymmetric outgassing - the                                               
dust and gas is mostly emitted into the sunward hemisphere - the nucleus is ac-                                                   
celerated away from the Sun (nongravitational forces). Compared with the purely                                                   
Keplerian orbit that it follows at large heliocentric distances, Halley 's orbit is extended                                      
by four days. This outgassing effect is irregular and therefore difficult to model. Bet-

of the International Halley Watch. From these observations, in combination with a

km in a radial direction from the Sun, 989 km in the direction of the comet's orbital                                             
motion and 15 km perpendicular to the comet's orbital plane (these are 1 sigma values).                                           
In calculating these values, an offset of 500 km between the centre of brightness                                                 
(presumed to be the nucleus position) and the centre of mass (actual nucleus position)                                            
has been assumed, which is probably too pessimistic. For targeting purposes, the 1 sigma                                          
uncertainty ellipsoid reduces to an ellipse in the target plane, defined by the Giotto                                            
arrival direction. With the same assumption on the offset, its two components are 231                                             
and 131 km. To these values has to be added the Giotto spacecraft position uncertainty                                            
of 80-100 km to give the overall targeting uncertainty. The resulting uncertainty of                                              
200-300 km is still relatively large compared with the intended flyby distance of 500

information on to Giotto. This is the so-called 'Pathfinder Concept', the principle of                                            
which is illustrated in Figure 21.                                                                                                
 The uncertainty in spacecraft position (~ 100 km) is shown in Figure 21 as a small                                               
circle around the spacecraft path, at the time when the last orbit-correction manoeuvre                                           
will have to be made (1-2 days before the encounter). The large circle around the                                                 
path of the comet reflects the relatively large 1 sigma uncertainty that can be achieved via                                      
the Astrometry Net. Vega will locate the comet nucleus during its flyby on 6 March

of Halley's Comet on 8 May 1910                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                  
After processing of the data, the position of the comet nucleus will be known with a                                              
much better accuracy (small circle around the Halley path). Giotto will be targeted to                                            
the centre of the small circle projected to the intersection of the comet and the                                                 
spacecraft paths. Between the time of nucleus detection by Vega and the Giotto en-                                                
counter, the uncertainty will grow slightly due to the nongravitational forces, which                                             
cannot be modelled precisely. It has been estimated that the Pathfinder Concept will                                              
reduce the targeting uncertainty to 130 km (1 sigma).                                                                             
 Although Giotto will be targeted very close to the comet nucleus, where the dust                                                 
fluxes are high, the spacecraft is expected to survive. The perhaps most serious of all                                           
problems could be caused by spacecraft attitude changes following the impact of a                                                 
large dust particle on the edge of the shield. Anything more than a 1 deg deviation from                                          
the nominal attitude would result in loss of the X-band downlink. Calculation's show                                              
that this could occur following impact of a dust particle of >~ 0.1 g mass. However,                                              
according to current estimates of dust densities in the cometary coma, the probability                                            
of an impact of a dust particle with mass >= 0.1 g on the spacecraft is only a few per-                                           
cent. Giotto might well then survive the encounter, in which case it might be possible                                            
to retarget it towards the end of March 1986 (delta V = 110 m/s required) to return to                                            
Earth in 1990. With a series of Earth and/or lunar swingby manoeuvres, Giotto could                                               
then be sent off to another comet or to an asteroid.
