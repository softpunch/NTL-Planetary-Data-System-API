Normally, this index would contain indices into the files of this volume.     
However, these data are so primitive with respect to the current (V3.8)       
PDS Standards that the minimal labels included do not actually contain        
enough information for the usual tools to generate a meaningful index.  So    
the usually required PDS manifest index is not present. The CHECKSUM.TAB      
file does contain a complete listing, of course, and can serve as a simple    
manifest if one is needed.

The various file types are described in "nettabinfo.txt".  This index is      
very useful for finding specific files based on IHW keywords, but note that   
the directory structure of this volume is different from that of the          
original HAL_0024 combined volume.
