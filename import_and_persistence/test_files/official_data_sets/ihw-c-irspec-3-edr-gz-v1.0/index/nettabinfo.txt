     This information file is located in the INDEX directory.                 
                                                                              
     This file contains a description of the index files located in the INDEX 
directory and a subdirectory, NETABLES.  Within INDEX there are 4 indices.    
Within the NETABLES subdirectory there are 20 indices from the so-called      
"printed archive," and 6 indices that are Discipline-specific and contain a   
large fraction of all FITS keywords from those Disciplines.  The 4 indices in 
this directory are described below; the 26 indices in the NETABLES            
subdirectory are described in the NETINFO.TXT file located in that            
subdirectory.                                                                 
                                                                              
                                                                              
     CDSTRUCT     -- The CD-ROM structure file contains the filename of all   
                     files on this CD-ROM, along with file size, starting     
                     block, allocation, and the complete path for this disc.  
                                                                              
     EPHEM        -- The Ephemeris file contains the complete ephemeris data  
                     for the period from November 26, 1981 through June 23,   
                     1989.                                                    
                                                                              
     PATHTABL     -- The Path Table file contains complete path information   
                     for all of the datafiles, headers, and labels for this   
                     disc.                                                    
                                                                              
     QUIK         -- The Quick Look file contains the values, in chronological
                     order, of the IHW mandatory keywords for all Disciplines 
                     for this disc.                                           
                                                                              
     Each of the indices mentioned above, as well as the ones within the      
NETABLES subdirectory, are made up of 5 files as described below.             
                                                                              
                                                                              
        *.DBF - These are dBASE III+ compatible database files. They do not   
                contain any data records, only the structure of the           
                corresponding database. The data records may be appended from 
                the data tables (in the .IDX files). Many database management 
                systems can import databases from .DBF files.                 
                                                                              
        *.IDX - These files contain the actual data records from each table.  
                They are delimited tables. Numeric fields are delimited by    
                commas (,) and ASCII text fields are contained in quotes (")  
                and also delimited with commas. Each line ends with the       
                characters <CR><LF> (ASCII 13 and 10 respectively). All fields
                in the tables are fixed width to facilitate their use in that 
                format, as well. These files may be appended to the end of an 
                empty database structure to create the full index database.   
                                                                              
        *.HDR - These are the FITS headers describing the *.IDX files in terms
                of FITS tables.  By concatenating the *.HDR and *.IDX files   
                into one file a true FITS table byte stream could be          
                generated.                                                    
                                                                              
        *.LBL - These are PDS labels describing the data tables.  They already
                contain pointers to the data tables, so no further steps are  
                required to make them accessible to PDS table-processing      
                software.                                                     
                                                                              
        *.STR - These are "structure" files. They contain information, in     
                delimited format, on the number, names and widths of the      
                fields in each database. They can used by dBASE III for       
                creating the printed archive index tables, and also document  
                the structure of each table.                                  
                                                                              
     In order to use dBASE III to create a database from these files, issue   
the following commands at the "." (dot) prompt:                               
                                                                              
     . use <filename>                                                         
     . append from <filename>.idx delimited                                   
                                                                              
where <filename> is one of CDSTRUCT (a file of physcial sector locations),    
EPHEM, NETABLES, QUIK* or PATHTABL.  Most database programs can import dBASE  
III compatible files.  In order to use another database program to manage the 
index tables, you will need to import the (empty) index from the appropriate  
.DBF file, then append the data from the corresponding .IDX file.             
                                                                              
     There is one additional file in the INDEX directory.  STRUCT.DBF is the  
database used to create all the other databases. It consists of 4 fields,     
FIELD_NAME, FIELD_TYPE, FIELD_LEN and FIELD_DEC, which document the structure 
of the index tables. When the appropriate .STR file is appended to this       
structure database, dBASE III+ can create the corresponding index database.
