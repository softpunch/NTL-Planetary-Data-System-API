1. BACKGROUND AND SCOPE OF COMPACT DISC                                       
                                                                              
     This compact disc contains observations of comet Giacobini-Zinner        
from the apparition in 1984-1987.  During that period, the International      
Halley Watch (IHW) mounted a campaign to observe the comet in support of      
the NASA project to fly the International Cometary Explorer (ICE)             
spacecraft through the comet's tail.  The data from that apparition and       
encounter form a database which is being placed on this compact disc as       
a test for the larger project to catalogue the data collected on comet        
Halley.                                                                       
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
2. ACCESSING THE DISC                                                         
                                                                              
     These discs have been manufactured following the normal specifications   
for Compact Disc Read Only Memory (CD-ROM) as well as the logical structure   
outlined by the International Standards Organization (ISO) in the No. 9660    
                                                                              
document.  A basic system requirement demands that the CD-ROM reader and      
software driver support this standard.  At this writing (July 1990), primary  
                                                                              
access to the disc will be using IBM-PC or compatible computers.  However,    
software support from vendors for the Apple MacIntosh II and some workstations
(SUN, MicroVAX) is now available.                                             
                                                                              
     If you are using a PC style machine, the reader that you bought should   
                                                                              
include the appropriate hardware (a PC-bus or SCSI controller board and       
cable) and software to address your device.  Software packages should include 
a device driver for your machine and extensions to DOS that allow the reader  
to "look" like another random access disk drive; the de facto standard here is
the Microsoft Extensions (MSCDEX 2.0 or higher).  Install the specific device 
driver software as directed by the documentation accompanying the hardware.   
Usually, this will involve specifying the device driver in a DEVICE= line in  
the CONFIG.SYS file and invoke the extensions package from your AUTOEXEC.BAT  
file.  This will automatically configure the CD-ROM reader when the computer  
is booted.                                                                    
                                                                              
     Remember that the CD-ROM reader is assigned a drive name which you have  
either chosen with the appropriate command line switch (/L:H assigns the CD-  
ROM reader to drive H:) or allowed to default to the next available device    
letter in your system.  Typical PC configurations will have two floppies (A:  
and B:), and a hard disk (C:).  Put your drive at some letter higher than     
that.  Remember that many DOS commands work on the CD-ROM but that it is a    
read-only medium.  Some of the useful DOS functions are:                      
                                                                              
        DIR   - directory listing                                             
        CHDIR - change directory (also CD)                                    
        TYPE  - list the contents of a file on the screen; useful             
                for normal text with <carriage return>, <line feed>           
                delimiters                                                    
        COPY  - copy file(s) to another device                                
        PRINT - print file on hard copy device                                
                                                                              
     Notice that commands such as DEL and MKDIR are not available since the   
CD-ROM is a read-only medium.  Furthermore, some compact disc software        
packages will invoke screen plots that may depend on the DOS program          
GRAPHICS.COM.  In this case, execute it in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file or before   
you run the software package.                                                 
                                                                              
     The IHW CD-ROMs have been designed to allow maximum access to the data   
using existing software developed within NASA, as well as user-supplied       
programs.  In particular, each data file was originally supplied in the FITS  
format, and also has a detached PDS label to describe the data structure.     
Furthermore, the FITS (.FIT) files have had the headers placed in separate    
files (with extension .HDR) from the data (.DAT, .IBG, .IMG, .IMQ, .TAB).     
The headers have been separated to allow unrestricted access to the data by   
non-FITS programs.  The sizes of all header and data files have been preserved
as integer multiples of 2880 bytes (required by FITS) in order to facilitate  
the reconstruction of the original FITS bytestream by concatenating the data  
file with the appropriate header file.                                        
                                                                              
                                                                              
3. DATA PRODUCTS                                                              
                                                                              
     A large number of scientists have contributed to this archive            
project.  The contributing observatories, with their IHW system codes,        
are summarized in a separate file (OBSCODES.TXT).  Individual observers       
and their various instruments are identified in the header that               
accompanies the data.                                                         
                                                                              
     The ground-based data is located in chronological directories. The       
directory names are based on date, specified by UT year, month, day and       
hour.  We have attempted to restrict directories to a reasonable              
size while allowing enough information for useful browsing. The average       
number of files in a directory is less than 70, although in one case          
(August 12, 1985) splitting the directory at the hour level was necessary     
to reduce the number of files.  The average subdirectory size is less         
than 0.5 MByte.  No subdirectory was created for days on which no             
observations were made.  For the images from the Large Scale Phenomena        
Network (LSPN), the data has been compressed and subsampled.   The            
latter occurs twice on the disc: in the chronological listing and in a        
separate directory.   The LSPN images are in the COMPRESS and BROWSE          
subdirectories, respectively.  The associated FITS headers and PDS labels     
also appear in each subdirectory.                                             
                                                                              
     In an effort to reduce the space requirements for the full Halley        
Archive, data compression was applied to the images. It has been used         
on the images of P/Giacobini-Zinner included on this disk.  An algorithm      
based on successive differences between pixels (Previous Pixel) has been      
developed to reduce the digital images from the LSPN to a coded byte          
string of 8-bit data.  The compression yields files roughly 60% the size      
of the original images.  Details of the algorithm and the accompanying        
FITS proposal are in the file FITSCOMP.TXT in this directory.                 
Decompression of data is limited by transfer rates, so a subsampled set of    
images (browse images) is also supplied. These images are restricted to       
a maximum of 256 pixels on a side and preserve the original sampling          
geometry.  In addition, the original 10-bit data has been rescaled to 8       
bits.                                                                         
                                                                              
     Some networks have submitted supplemental data which include filter      
tables, non-comet images, flat fields, and laboratory spectra.  These         
are stored in the CALIB subdirectory and except for the Infrared Filter       
Tables (IRFT) appear in the chronological directories.                        
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
4. DIRECTORY STRUCTURE                                                        
                                                                              
     The volume and directory structure of this disk conform to the           
Level-1 standard specified by the ISO.  This format is widely accepted        
and used on a variety of machines.  The AAREADME.TXT file in the root         
directory introduces the user to the full extent of the archive and the       
contents of the individual subdirectories.                                    
                                                                              
     There are three directories (DOCUMENT, INDEX and SOFTWARE) on the        
CD-ROM that contain supplementary files. In addition, to correlate the        
chronological observations with physical location of the comet, some          
recent ephemeris information has been included (in the subdirectory           
EPHEM).  The table (EPHEM.TAB) contains information at daily intervals,       
so an interpolation routine is also provided; more information is in the      
text (EPHEM.TXT) file.                                                        
                                                                              
     The DOCUMENT subdirectory contains text files that give the              
background to this CD-ROM project and a general guide to its use.             
An explanatory discussion of the FITS and PDS formats used                    
specifically for the P/Giacobini-Zinner data is located in the files          
*INFO.TXT.  This file (GZGUIDE.TXT) is an overview.   Some files may          
also appear as a printed volume of the data (see Preface).  Detailed          
appendices, written by the individual Disciplines of the IHW, contain         
information on the data collection and processing.  Finally, some             
documentation has been duplicated at the beginning of special                 
directories, e.g., CROMMELN.                                                  
                                                                              
     Tables of useful index information have been collected in three          
forms in order to allow automated searching of the data.  The QUIK            
tables contain the full set of mandatory FITS keywords from all               
disciplines; the two tables cover the pre- and post-perihelion passage        
of the comet.  A second set of tables contains the data from the              
proposed printed archive (in the subdirectory NETABLES), split by             
discipline and subnet, and finally chronologically ordered  in each           
table.  The full set of keywords (COMMENTS, HISTORY) for four networks        
(Amateur (Visual), Large-Scale Phenomena, Radio, Spectroscopy) are in         
additional tables as specified by each group.  These tables are in files      
NETAMATV.IDX, NETLARGE.IDX, NETSPECT.IDX and NETRADIO.IDX.  We have also      
made the index tables transportable to relational DBMS by delimiting the      
tables and providing structure, program, and dBASE-compatible .DBF            
files.   Further information is contained in the file INDXINFO.TXT.           
                                                                              
   The SOFTWARE subdirectory contains program code for a few utilities,       
in this case, decompression of images and the interpolation of ephemeris      
tables for the comet.  The Previous Pixel algorithm used to compress the      
images is described in the file FITSCOMP.TXT.  It was developed and           
implemented by the LSPN at Goddard Space Flight Center.  Pseudocode for       
this algorithm is listed (COMPRESS.TXT) as well as the IDL procedure          
(PREVPIX.PRO) originally used to perform the compression.  Fortran and C      
code are provided for image decompression, but there has been no attempt      
to supply fully executable programs.  An interpolation program was

5. FILENAMING CONVENTION                                                      
                                                                              
                                                                              
     The International Halley Watch agreed early on in the project that       
all data would be submitted from the individual disciplines to the Lead       
Center using the FITS format.  When the decision was made to distribute       
this information on CD-ROM, it was determined that the data had to have       
even broader accessibility.  For this reason, the original FITS files,        
with contiguous headers and data, were split into separate files. The         
original FITS byte stream could then be recovered by concatenating the        
appropriate header and data files.   In addition, detached PDS labels         
were constructed to allow parallel, definition of the data files for the      
Planetary Data System. (We thankfully acknowledge the help of M. Martin,      
PDS, for assisting the IHW through version 1.1 of the Object Description      
Language to describe the SPECTRUM object.)                                    
                                                                              
     The convention for naming files on the CD-ROM was proposed by the        
IHW Lead Center to include a unique data qualifier for the data.   A          
specific set of rules was established to identify the network/subnetwork for  
each discipline (given by a letter code).  A CD-ROM running number relates    
the information contained in the various indexes to the files.   In the       
case of calibration data, the same network/subnetwork code is used but the    
number starts at 8001.   A short list organized by Discipline (Number) and    
listing network/subnetwork is given below:

     The file extensions follow suggestions by the Planetary Data System      
(SPIDS v1.1) for tabular and image data.    In addition, for IHW FITS, the    
original headers and data were split into separate files, with filename       
extensions as listed below.                                                   
                                                                              
                 .DAT - other non-imaging or non-tabular data                 
                 .FIT - original FITS records                                 
                 .HDR - FITS header records                                   
                 .IBG - data records for subsampled images                    
                 .IMG - imaging data records                                  
                 .IMQ - data records for compressed images                    
                 .LBL - detached PDS stream format                            
                 .TAB - tabular data records                                  
                                                                              
     In re-organizing the original FITS files, we have attempted to make      
the data available to a larger community.  For transporting data to           
analysis packages that demand FITS, the header and data files may be          
concatenated to create a fully valid FITS byte stream, as the original        
structure of the FITS headers and data has been preserved.  The tabular       
data, even though presented as valid FITS data records, are really just       
ASCII byte strings that can be exported to many machines.                     
                                                                              
     Inclusion of the PDS labels allows use of CD-ROM imaging software        
already available from PDS.  The PDS labels are text files, with lines        
terminated by the <CR><LF> characters. The total size of the files is         
maintained in the required SFDU_LABEL.                                        
                                                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
6. AVAILABLE SOFTWARE                                                         
                                                                              
     At the present, no executable software is included with the CD-ROM       
except for programs supporting the ephemeris.  We have designed the data      
formats to be compatible with many existing packages and plan to              
distribute two public domain packages, IMDISP (from JPL) and FITSREAD         
(from the ADC) on an accompanying floppy disk.  We may also supplement        
this release with a printed manual and some support programs for              
manipulating the data (FITSUTIL, FITSCONV).
