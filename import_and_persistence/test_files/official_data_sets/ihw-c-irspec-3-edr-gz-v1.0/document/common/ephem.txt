     The geocentric ephemeris for 0h UT each day has been calculated by the   
Astrometry Network from the following set of osculating orbital elements      
(Astrometry Network orbit no. 37).  The orbital solution was fit to 1145      
astrometric observations over the interval from 1972 March 11 to 1987 March 31
with a rms residual = 1.1 arcsec.  Full planetary and nongravitational        
perturbations have been taken into account at each time step in the ephemeris 
computations.  The angular elements are referred to the ecliptic plane and the
equinox of 1950.

     The following osculating orbital elements are consistent with orbit No.  
37 for comet Giacobini-Zinner.  Using these orbital elements and the export   
version of the Astrometry Network's Two-Body Ephemeris Generation program,    
users can generate their own ephemeris information.  If care is taken to use  
the set of orbital elements with the epoch of osculation closest to the       
desired ephemeris dates, the Two-Body program can generate ephemeris          
information that is equivalent to corresponding information in the perturbed  
ephemeris (to approximately the one arc second level of accuracy).  Each set  
of orbital elements is in the same order as the elements listed above - the   
only differences being that the epochs of osculation and dates of perihelion  
passage time are given as Julian dates rather than calendar dates.  The second
line of each element set contains the calendar date corresponding to the epoch
directly above it on the first line.

     The program OBSNTERP is an interactive, seven point Lagrange inter-      
polation program that will return ephemeris data for periodic comet Giacobini-
Zinner over the interval January 5, 1984 through May 27, 1987.  To run the    
program, type OBSNTERP <carriage return> and respond to the prompts.  The     
executable requires a math co-processor.  The Fortran source code is given in 
the files labeled with the extension .FOR and the ephemeris data table for    
comet Giacobini-Zinner is EPHEM.TAB.  You can speed up the interpolation time 
by shortening the data table to include only the interval that you require and
by requesting output for dates in chronological order.  The information in the
data table was generated with IHW orbit number 37, which was based upon 1145  
astrometric positions over the interval March 11, 1972 through March 31, 1987.
(Each line of the table is a fixed width of 110 characters plus <CR> <LF>.)
