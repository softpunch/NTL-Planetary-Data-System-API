                    Description of DIS-CODE Table.                            
                                                                              
     The files CODE.TAB, CODE.STR,CODE.FIT, CODE.HHH  contain  a  data        
table  listingthe  discipline  codes  (DIS-CODE)  and their associated        
parameters used in the comet  Giacobini-Zinner  archive,  a  delimited        
table describing the columns in the table, a FITS table header for the        
data (with 2880 byte records), and a FITS table header which is easily        
displayable  (with  80  byte records).  This table listing can be read        
into a database and used to translate the DIS-CODE  and  SYSTEM  codes        
used  by the Spectroscopy and Spectrophotometry Network.  The DIS-CODE        
table (in CODE.TAB) is in  a  delimited  table  format,  having  fixed        
column sizes, seperated by commas (,), with character strings inclosed        
in double quotes (").                                                         
                                                                              
     The columns of the DIS-CODE table include the following keywords:        
SYSTEM, DIS-CODE, OBSVTORY, TELESCOP, INSTRUME, APERSIZE, RESOL-SP and        
RANGE-SP.  The values of these keywords are more  fully  described  in        
the  file  DESCRIPT.TXT.   The columns were written with the following        
FORTRAN format:                                                               
                                                                              
        FORMAT('"',I8,'","',I9.9,'","',A68,'","',A40,'","',                   
     &  A68,'","',A20,'","',A5,'","',A10,'"',2A1)                             
                                                                              
Each line is terminated with two ASCII characters for carriage  return        
and  line  feed  (CR and LF, or 0D and 0A in hexadecimal).  This is to        
allow the table to be easily read into a typical database program.            
                                                                              
     To aid in the entering of the table into a database program,  the        
CODE.STR  file  contains  another  delimited  table (although not with        
fixed column widths), describing the columns in  the  DIS-CODE  table,        
giving  the  field  title,  type and width.  This table may be used to        
define a format in a database program for the DIS-CODE table.                 
                                                                              
     The CODE.FIT file contains a header for a file with  FITS  format        
table  extensions,  which  when  attached  to  the data (in CODE.TAB),        
should form a valid FITS format  table  file  (when  blocked  to  2880        
bytes).  The CODE.HHH file contains the same header information as the        
CODE.FIT file, but blocked to 80 byte records, for easy display.
