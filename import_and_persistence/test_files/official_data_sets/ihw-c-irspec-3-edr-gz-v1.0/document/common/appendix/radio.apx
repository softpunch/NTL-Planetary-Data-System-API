          Radio Astronomy is a developing new technique for the study of comets.                                                  
In some areas, such as observations of the OH radical via its 18 cm transitions,                                                  
the observational procedures and analysis are well developed.  Studies in these                                                   
areas have proved their value since they both provide new probes of important                                                     
physical processes as well as a window on physical processes which are less well                                                  
known and less amenable to study by other techniques.  In many other areas, how-                                                  
ever, the study of comets at radio wavelengths continues to be primarily an                                                       
exploratory endeavor.  In recognition of this fact, the IHW Radio Science Disci-

different kinds of observations, since each observation tends to have some                                                        
scientific merit as an exploration. Thus, we have been careful to document and

          The IHW Radio Science archive is in FITS format.  The FITS files con-                                                   
sist of a header, which contains information on the observation, and data in a                                                    
format specified by the FITS header.  The header and the data are presented in                                                    
two different files to facilitate their use by a wide range of analysis soft-                                                     
ware.  Users who require FITS format files have only to concatenate the header                                                    
and the data files to make a standard FITS file for a particular observation.                                                     
                                                                                                                                  
          The FITS header is meant to give a description of the structure and                                                     
format of the FITS data records which follow it and to provide any auxiliary                                                      
information that is necessary for its interpretation.  For the Radio Science                                                      
FITS header, we have defined several FITS keywords which specify observational                                                    
parameters which are necessary to interpret the data.  A detailed description                                                     
of the complete Radio Science FITS header is provided in Sec. III.  In general,                                                   
the Radio Science Network has tried to conform to standards which are commonly                                                    
used in FITS and adopted by the IHW.  The characteristics of the observation are                                                  
described by assigning values to the keywords which are described in Sec. III.                                                    
Special keywords have been selected to provide information vital to the data                                                      
interpretation, such as specification of the observing frequency or telescope                                                     
parameters.  At another level, under the FITS HISTORY keywords, we describe how                                                   
the data were obtained, including calibration and orbital tracking information.                                                   
The organization of the parameters into these groups is admittedly somewhat                                                       
arbitrary and has been made primarily to limit the number of new FITS keywords

expected that on many occasions attempts to detect the comet will fail.  These                                                    
nondetections are best described by an appropriate upper limit rather than

IHW permits FITS files to be created without any data records; the limit is then                                                  
listed in the FITS HISTORY section of the Radio Science header.  The FITS files                                                   
of this type have the NAXIS keyword set equal to 0 and the DAT-TYPE keyword set                                                   
equal to the character string 'NODATA  '.

provides most of the information that is necessary to make use of the data, as                                                    
well as the "data summary" information included in the FITS headers, such as                                                      
the line peak intensity and width for spectral line observations.  The format

          Since the OH Subnetwork and the Spectral Line Subnetwork contain the                                                    
same data type, it is most economical to print both subnetworks together in the                                                   
same subsection of the Radio Science part of the archive.  Detailed description

          We have attempted to use a fixed set of standard units for the values                                                   
given in the IHW archive.  These units are given in Table X.  Where these units                                                   
are not used, as in the printed archive, the index tables, or in certain values                                                   
in the HISTORY section of the FITS headers, the change of units is explicitly                                                     
mentioned.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                  
          The adoption of the flux density unit, Jansky per Beam (Jy/Beam),                                                       
deserves an additional comment.  This unit is well defined: the signal is                                                         
described in terms of the flux density of a point source which would produce the                                                  
same signal as that observed from the comet.  The explicit use of "per Beam" in                                                   
the unit acknowledges that the coma is possibly resolved by the beam to an                                                        
unknown extent.  Some observatories, such as the VLA, have naturally already                                                      
adopted this choice of units since they use celestial point sources to calibrate                                                  
the instrument.  All continuum observations also use Janskys to express their                                                     
results regardless of how the data are actually internally calibrated.  Thus,                                                     
in both of these cases, the Jansky is the obvious choice of unit.  For spectral                                                   
line work on large single antennas, however, results are typically expressed in                                                   
"antenna temperature" since they are calibrated by comparing the observed                                                         
signal to a calibration signal of known noise temperature.  In recent years,                                                      
this unit has become rather confusing as a result of efforts to convert a                                                         
relatively well defined observed quantity into a more physically meaningful                                                       
unit which gives an approximation to the true brightness temperature of the                                                       
source.  Thus, various forms of "corrected" antenna temperature are in use at                                                     
different observatories, and it is often not clear which corrections have been                                                    
made to the data.  We therefore favor a system in which the calibration is                                                        
achieved by direct comparison of the cometary signal to celestial sources of                                                      
known flux density, and the natural unit for such a comparison is the unit of                                                     
flux density, the Jansky.  Thus, all observations in the archive have been                                                        
converted to these units using data provided by the observers.

density scale.  The calibration scale for radio astronomy is well established at                                                  
centimeter wavelengths, and in general, well known standard sources were used by                                                  
the network observers.  For wavelengths shorter than about 1 centimeter, how-                                                     
ever, the calibration becomes less precise as atmospheric attenuation becomes                                                     
significant in the observations. In most cases, comparisons to celestial sources                                                  
are more indirect and observers rely on absolute calibration schemes as their                                                     
primary method.  Ultimately, though, even these techniques use known sources,                                                     
such as the planets, to calibrate the system, and we have attempted to archive                                                    
information about these calibration sources with each observation.                                                                
                                                                                                                                  
          Calibration information that is supplied to us by the observer is                                                       
given in the HISTORY section of the FITS header.  The HISTORY  CALMETH keyword                                                    
provides an ASCII string with a brief description of the calibration method                                                       
used.  Three methods are commonly used: (1) STANDARDS indicates that the data                                                     
were calibrated through direct comparison to standard sources; (2) NOISE TUBE                                                     
indicates that the data were primarily calibrated by injecting power from a                                                       
noise source into the receiver; (3) CHOPPER WHEEL indicates that the "chopper                                                     
wheel" method was used.  This latter method uses the comparison of the noise                                                      
power from an ambient temperature load to that produced by the sky emission to                                                    
make an estimate of the optical depth of the atmosphere, and it is commonly                                                       
used at millimeter wavelengths.                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                  
          Even in the cases of NOISE TUBE and CHOPPER WHEEL calibration, where                                                    
celestial sources are not initially used to calibrate the data, the final                                                         
calibration is generally made with celestial sources.  Whenever a standard                                                        
source is used for this purpose, its name and assumed flux density are given in                                                   
the HISTORY  CALSRCE keywords.  More than one of these keywords may exist in                                                      
the header if more than one calibration source is used.  For planetary sources,                                                   
the assumed brightness temperature is given rather than the flux density since                                                    
planetary flux densities vary with distance to the object.  Finally, the system

receiver noise and atmospheric and ground pickup) and the receiver temperature                                                    
(defined to be the noise temperature of the receiver alone) are given in the                                                      
HISTORY  TSYSTEM and HISTORY  TRCVR keywords; the atmospheric opacity at zenith                                                   
is given in the HISTORY  TAUZENTH keyword where appropriate.

to the archive, since if it were not for their interest and assistance, then                                                      
there would be no archive.  We also appreciate those who attempted to observe                                                     
comet P/Giacobini-Zinner even if they did not get useful data.  In many cases,                                                    
these early attempts paid off in our later studies of comet Halley.  The Disci-
