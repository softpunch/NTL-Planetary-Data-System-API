I. INTRODUCTION                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                  
	The narrow-band photometry of the Photometry and Polarimetry Network                                                             
(PPN) grew out of a previous program of narrow-band photometry of comets carried                                                  
out by M.F. A'Hearn and R.L. Millis.  That program led first to the creation in                                                   
1979 of a working group on standard filters under the auspices of Commission 15                                                   
of the International Astronomical Union.  Standard filters were defined and                                                       
purchased with a grant from the U.S. National Science Foundation for a worldwide                                                  
distribution.  These activities were merged with those of the IHW when A'Hearn                                                    
was selected as the PPN Discipline Specialist (Table I).

	Creation of the IHW also required a broadening of the effort to include                                                          
broad-band photometry, to be emphasized when the comet was faint, and                                                             
polarimetry, to be done with the narrow-band filters in order to separate                                                         
the polarization of emission bands from that of the reflected continuum.                                                          
Narrow-band filters were therefore distributed to both photometrists and                                                          
polarimetrists.                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                  
	In order to ensure homogeneity of the results, an extensive effort was                                                           
made to establish a standard photometric system with a list of standard                                                           
stars distributed around the sky.  The efforts of several observers were                                                          
enlisted and the analysis to establish the standard system was led by                                                             
W. Osborn.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                  
	Realizing that many potential observers were likely to have had little                                                           
experience with cometary observations and also recognizing that the standard                                                      
photometric system might not be in final form until late in the apparition                                                        
of comet P/Halley and after the apparition of comet P/Giacobini-Zinner, it                                                        
was decided that final calibrations of the narrow-band photometry would                                                           
be done at the office of the Discipline Specialist at the University of

was carried out at the office of the Discipline Specialist.                                                                       
                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                  
II. NARROW-BAND FILTERS                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                  
	The narrow-band filters that were distributed to both photometrists                                                              
and polarimetrists came from a variety of sources. Although the manufacturers                                                     
tried to maintain uniformity among the filters, they were not entirely                                                            
successful. Since the transformations from measured magnitudes to fluxes                                                          
depend on the actual profiles of the filters, the differences among the                                                           
transmission profiles of the different filters are discussed.                                                                     
                                                                                                                                  
	It should be kept in mind that the characteristics of the bandpasses                                                             
of interference filters change with time, some much more than others.  There                                                      
are several reports of noticeable changes in some of the IHW filters since                                                        
the time of distribution.  All measurements reported here are based on data                                                       
taken prior to distribution of the filters, that is, around 1982-83, except                                                       
for the profile of the OH filter which was remeasured in 1988 and the profiles                                                    
of the NH filters which were measured by the manufacturer in 1979.                                                                
                                                                                                                                  
	Because the OH and NH filters are treated differently from the

of this section. All filters are identified by the nominal central

letter indicating the manufacturer plus a sequential number.

	This filter was designed to measure the 0-0 band of the A-X

not contribute a large fraction of the total light. The formula for flux                                                          
in Section IV.B gives the flux in the 0-0 band alone. These filters                                                               
were all manufactured by Spectro-Film, Inc. of Winchester, Mass.,                                                                 
and are, in a sense, a special case because the primary bandpass is                                                               
centered near 3075A with a full-width-half-maximum FWHM = 80A but there                                                           
is also a secondary bandpass near 3580A which is lower in transmission                                                            
by more than two orders of magnitude but wider by about one order of

that of the primary bandpass. This secondary bandpass is the dominant

is so much greater at the wavelength of the secondary bandpass than at                                                            
the wavelength of the primary bandpass.

	The filters for NH were not distributed as part of the IHW effort                                                                
but several older filters were available from previous programs. These                                                            
filters were used at Lowell Observatory, at Cerro Tololo Inter-American                                                           
Observatory, and at Perth Observatory. They were chosen to measure the                                                            
delta-v = 0 sequence of the A-X system of NH. Although the entire                                                                 
sequence is in the bandpass, virtually all of the light is from the 0-0                                                           
band because the Franck-Condon factors are low for the other bands. The                                                           
filters were also manufactured by Spectro-Film, Inc. although many years                                                          
before the OH filters. Since the NH filters are not very well matched,                                                            
the only way to characterize them is to present the transmission curve

came out rather different. Although the filter is intended for the

A. Standards for Narrow-Band Photometry                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                  
	An extensive set of standard stars was defined using the narrow-band                                                             
filters distributed by the IHW.  Primary standard stars were chosen to be of                                                      
two types: solar analogs and stars of spectral types O9-B3.  The early-type                                                       
stars were chosen to have the most line-free spectra and to be distributed                                                        
along the celestial equator while the solar analogs were chosen to be                                                             
those most nearly like the Sun in the work of Hardorp (1978, 1980a,b, 1982).                                                      
The solar analogs were used to determine the continuum underlying the                                                             
emission bands of the comet and are marked in the table below.  Secondary                                                         
standards were chosen in other parts of the sky.                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                  
	 Observations were obtained at several sites using different sets                                                                
of the standard filters and different photometers.  The observations were                                                         
synthesized by W. Osborn to establish the standard magnitudes.  The zero-                                                         
point of the system was arbitrarily set to be m = 5.88 for all filters for the                                                    
star 53 Psc = HD 3379 (V = 5.88).  Empirically there appears to be nothing                                                        
more than a zero point shift between instrumental magnitudes and the standard                                                     
magnitudes in nearly all cases.  In a few cases, that is, for certain sets of                                                     
filters, the zero point shift of the CN filter is slightly different for                                                          
G-stars and for B-stars and presumably, therefore, for comets.  A complete                                                        
paper on the standards is in preparation at the time of this writing and a more                                                   
complete discussion of the standards will appear among the appendices to the

A. Atmospheric Effects and Reduction to Standard Magnitudes                                                                       
                                                                                                                                  
	The most basic data with which we could begin reductions consisted

sky. In the case of measurements with direct-current systems rather than                                                          
pulse-counting systems, the most basic data would consist of readings                                                             
from the d.c. amplifier and Universal Times. Some observers submitted                                                             
data in various stages of reduction beyond these most basic data and                                                              
in general we do not know the details of the reductions applied by such                                                           
observers. We will describe here the complete reduction from the most                                                             
basic data as we carried it out.                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                  
	Instrumental magnitudes were derived by first correcting all

were converted to instrumental magnitudes by choosing an appropriate

	Although atmospheric attenuation is normally linear with airmass as                                                              
defined above, this is not the case for observations with the OH filters                                                          
because the monochromatic attenuation varies drastically across the                                                               
bandpass. In order to simplify the reductions, particularly when only                                                             
limited data were available, the non-linearity of the atmospheric                                                                 
attenuation was modelled by defining an effective airmass, Xeff, such                                                             
that attenuation would be linear in this variable. Unfortunately, the                                                             
non-linearity varies from one site to another and even with time at a                                                             
single site due to differences in the amount of atmosphere above the                                                              
site (changing the Rayleigh component), in the amount of aerosol at the                                                           
site, and in the amount of ozone above the site. Furthermore, the                                                                 
non-linearity depends on the color of the source being observed.                                                                  
Fortunately we are interested only in sources of three colors -                                                                   
B-stars, solar analogs, and cometary emission bands. We can therefore                                                             
define effective airmasses separately for each of the three cases.                                                                
                                                                                                                                  
	The details of the atmospheric modelling will be described elsewhere                                                             
but our general approach, based on that of Hayes and Latham (1975), is to                                                         
use a three-component model for the atmosphere (Rayleigh, aerosol, ozone) to

determined atmospheric extinction for each night by two methods, conventional                                                     
fitting by least squares of magnitude vs. airmass for individual stars                                                            
and also a global least squares solution using all standards in which we                                                          
solved simultaneously for the extinction coefficient and the zero-point                                                           
shift from instrumental magnitude to standard magnitudes. The result of                                                           
the global solution was normally used unless the solutions for individual                                                         
stars suggested hemispheric asymmetries and/or temporal variations                                                                
during the night. In these cases we then solved separately for different                                                          
hemispheres and/or parts of the night. In some cases we also averaged                                                             
several nights together to define average extinction coefficients either                                                          
when there were too few data on a particular night to determine

expected from the errors in the results of the individual nights.                                                                 
Different types of extinction fitting are noted in the remarks column of

magnitudes were transformed to the standard system by a least squares                                                             
solution for the zero-point shift with no color terms.                                                                            
                                                                                                                                  
	It was at this point that a certain amount of discretion was exercised                                                           
in our operation. If individual observations or even all the observations of                                                      
a single object seemed discrepant, and if we were able to identify a                                                              
physically plausible mechanism for producing the discrepancy, we often                                                            
discarded some observations. In a few cases, we even discarded the data                                                           
from entire nights at this point. We should point out that in some cases                                                          
the observers had already advised us that the data were of poor quality                                                           
but we had requested that they submit everything in the hope that we                                                              
could salvage some marginal data if it turned out to be critical for

of the observers were of great help in understanding the effects of

The flux per unit wavelength [erg/cm**2/s/A] is then given by:

The 'errors' given with the coefficients are a measure of the variation                                                           
in the flux transformation from one filter to another and, for a given                                                            
filter, with temperature over the range -20C to +20C.                                                                             
                                                                                                                                  
	Derivation of fluxes in emission bands is somewhat more complicated.                                                             
The first step is to remove the continuum which underlies the emission band                                                       
and which is also detected through the filters. This is done using the                                                            
colors of the solar analogs (Table VIII) and measurements of the comet                                                            
in any two continuum bandpasses - (3650,4845), (3650,6840), or                                                                    
(4845,6840). For each pair of filters, we interpolate (or extrapolate) the                                                        
magnitudes of the solar analogs to the wavelength of an emission-band                                                             
filter and determine the difference between the measured magnitude                                                                
and the interpolated magnitude, C. For the comet, we then interpolate the                                                         
magnitudes in the same two continuum filters and add C to estimate the                                                            
continuum contribution to the measured magnitude. This procedure is                                                               
accurate if the cometary continuum in magnitudes is redder (or bluer)                                                             
than the sun linearly with wavelength. If there is curvature or                                                                   
structure in the continuum reflectivity of the cometary grains, then                                                              
this procedure is not adequate. The general form of the equation is:                                                              
                                                                                                                                  
	mcont(i) = A*mcont(cont1) + (1-A)*mcont(cont2) + B(i)                                                                            
                                                                                                                                  
where i refers to the ith emission band designated by its wavelength,                                                             
A and (1-A) are the coefficients for the interpolation which depend only on

we give the coefficents for the continuum correction for each emission

We also give an error in B which is a measure of the scatter from one solar

C. Errors                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                  
	Errors were not always treated consistently. For the polarimetry                                                                 
we simply used the errors provided by the observers, who had been asked to                                                        
supply the standard deviation of the final answer, both for the percent                                                           
polarization and for the position angle.                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                  
	For the narrow-band photometry, we normally calculated the errors                                                                
ourselves by propagating the errors through each step of the reduction.                                                           
In some cases, however, we did not know the uncertainties, e.g., in the                                                           
raw count rates, and we had to guess these errors. Wherever possible, we                                                          
checked the scatter among different measurements to ensure that this was                                                          
consistent with the expected error in an individual measurement. If they                                                          
were not consistent, we always chose the larger error. This typically                                                             
occurred when we derived the zero-point shift to the standard magnitude                                                           
system. The scatter in zero-point shift from one standard star to                                                                 
another was often greater than one would expect from the uncertainties                                                            
in the raw counting rates and in the extinction determinations. The                                                               
resultant errors, when propagated through to the fluxes, represent only                                                           
the photometric uncertainty. They do not include uncertainties in the                                                             
transformation equations given above nor do they include uncertainties                                                            
due to the scatter in characteristics among the different filters.                                                                
                                                                                                                                  
	We do know that we have neglected one significant source of error.                                                               
As noted above, our algorithm for removing the continuum from the                                                                 
measurements of emission bands will only work if the reddening (in                                                                
magnitudes) is linear with wavelength. Empirically we have found that                                                             
frequently the flux of CO+ turns out to be negative. We have looked into                                                          
the contamination of the continuum bandpasses by emission bands and have                                                          
concluded that this is not the source of the problem. We suspect that                                                             
the real problem is due to non-linearity in the reddening of the solar                                                            
continuum by the cometary grains but we have no way of adequately                                                                 
dealing with this. The effect is most pronouced for CO+ because the band                                                          
is very weak compared to the continuum near the nucleus but the problem                                                           
is presumably present, to a lesser degree, for all emission bands.                                                                
                                                                                                                                  
	Other than the uncertainty due to the varying reflectivity of                                                                    
cometary grains, we believe that the photometric uncertainty is the largest                                                       
uncertainty in the results presented here and that the quoted errors are                                                          
reasonably realistic. We note that although the CO+ feature is                                                                    
frequently negative, it is virtually never more than 3-sigma negative.                                                            
In the data tables, our general policy has been to quote 1-sigma                                                                  
errors. If the result is less than 3-sigma, we have usually quoted a                                                              
3-sigma upper limit but in a few cases we have included results between                                                           
2- and 3-sigma together with the errors.
