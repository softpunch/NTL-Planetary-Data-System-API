          A summary of infrared observations during the 1984/85 apparition of

Comet Halley by many of the observers, and of intrinsic scientific interest for                                                   
this comet.  Highlights of the observations included striking infrared images,                                                    
low resolution spectroscopy, limited infrared polarimetry, and photometry.                                                        
                                                                                                                                  
          Although the IHW encouraged and assisted in planning the observations,                                                  
and interceded with observatories on behalf of the projects, a formally organ-

basis of experience gained from G-Z, such programs were later organized and                                                       
successfully executed for Comet Halley at several observatories.  The filter

          Several choices had to be made about what to include in the archive.                                                    
Considerable portions of the infrared data or analyses appear in the published                                                    
literature.  In the case of small data sets like photometry, the material was                                                     
included in the archive, with appropriate references, even if it also appears                                                     
in the literature.  On the other hand, the images, which were all published,                                                      
were included in digital form in the archive, but were not prepared for the                                                       
printed volumes.  The archive is a unique resource for these kinds of data.  We                                                   
emphasize that the G-Z archive should be used in conjunction with the original                                                    
literature sources by the investigators whenever possible.  It contains all the                                                   
published references known to us as of August 15, 1988.                                                                           
                                                                                                                                  
          When we knew of the existence of observations that were not submitted                                                   
for archiving (in fact, just one case), we created descriptive files and refer-                                                   
ences reflecting our knowledge of the data.  These may assist future searches.                                                    
It appears that the present archive is an essentially complete compendium of                                                      
infrared observations of Comet P/Giacobini-Zinner in the 1984/85 apparition.                                                      
Infrared spectroscopy and imaging data are contained in the digital G-Z archive                                                   
and, in many cases, in the published literature.  These data are not reproduced                                                   
in the printed archive which, in this instance, is a guide and index to the                                                       
primary references.                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                  
          The Infrared Studies column headings for the printed archive are                                                        
described in Table V.  Table VI contains keyword descriptions for the digital                                                     
archive.  These are essentially similar to or identical with the definitions                                                      
used by the other networks and comply with the FITS standards.
