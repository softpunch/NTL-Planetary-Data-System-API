I. INTRODUCTION                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                  
        For both comets P/Halley and P/Giacobini-Zinner, the Near Nucleus                                                         
Studies Network (NNSN) objectives were to advocate, coordinate, standardize,                                                      
and archive high resolution groundbased images. The members of the NNSN team                                                      
of discipline specialists are listed in Table I. For P/Giacobini-Zinner most                                                      
of the activities were carried out through the already established IHW NNSN,                                                      
and details of the observing circumstances were communicated to network mem-                                                      
bers in a series of newsletters. A primary justification for the international                                                    
Giacobini-Zinner campaign was to provide groundbased support for the Inter-                                                       
national Cometary Explorer (ICE) which passed through the middle of the plasma                                                    
tail 7800 km from the nucleus at 11:02 UT on September 11, 1985 (von Rosenvinge                                                   
et al. 1986). Originally designed for studies of the solar wind environment up-                                                   
stream from the Earth, the ICE spacecraft did not carry an imaging experiment,                                                    
and was thus dependent upon groundbased imaging to provide information on the                                                     
morphology of the flyby region to correlate with the in-situ fields and par-                                                      
ticles data. The groundbased imaging also permits comparison of the activity                                                      
of P/Giacobini-Zinner with that of other comets, in particular P/Halley. For                                                      
many observers, P/Giacobini-Zinner also offered an opportunity to refine their                                                    
observing techniques in preparation for P/Halley later in 1985.

        To aid the standardization of spectrally selective imaging, the NNSN                                                      
distributed 15 sets of 35mm circular imaging quality filters manufactured by                                                      
Barr Associates, Inc., Westford, MA, whose bandpasses matched closely those                                                       
of the eight IAU standard cometary filters used by the Photometry and Polar-                                                      
imetry Network. The characteristics of the IAU standard cometary filters are

Some observers used other filters that were available to them, or that were

        The 197 NNSN images in this archive (Table III) include the recovery                                                      
observations of April 3, 1984 and the observations from 22 days in the interval                                                   
May 17 to November 4, 1985. Most observations refer to dates close to the time                                                    
of the ICE encounter and were made by a group of the NNSN members who usually                                                     
observe comets as part of their research activity. Some of the NNSN observers                                                     
were preoccupied with preparing their observing campaigns for P/Halley, while                                                     
others used P/Giacobini-Zinner to experiment with new detectors or filters, and                                                   
elected not to submit their data.                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                  
        The primary purpose of high-resolution groundbased images was to relate                                                   
the observed spatial and temporal distribution of charged particles with the in-                                                  
situ fields and particles data from the ICE. For visible to near-infrared wave-                                                   
lengths, this usually meant observing the CO+ or H2O+ ions. The charge-coupled                                                    
device (CCD) images through the 703H2O+ filter obtained by Goldberg et al. with                                                   
the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (NNSN##498341-498347) some 3.6 hours after                                                     
the ICE flyby were analyzed by Slavin et al. (1986). It was found that the tail                                                   
widths measured from the ICE and CCD images were consistent if the ion emission                                                   
observed from the ground originated in a slab-shaped plasma sheet whose orien-                                                    
tation was controlled by the direction of the interplanetary magnetic field.                                                      
                                                                                                                                  
        A major scientific objective of the near nucleus studies was to obtain                                                    
images of the cometary coma with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution to                                                    
determine some fundamental properties of the unresolved nucleus. Since the coma                                                   
is a temporary atmosphere, a changing anisotropic pattern of ejected material                                                     
obviously reflects the distribution of outgassing and the motion of the nucleus.                                                  
For example, by digitally enhancing photographs of P/Halley taken in 1910, it                                                     
was demonstrated that the patterns of dust jets could be explained by emission                                                    
of dust from discrete active areas on the sunlit part of the rotating nucleus                                                     
(Sekanina and Larson 1984, 1986). As subsequent direct spacecraft observations                                                    
showed, the dust emission from P/Halley did indeed come from several vents in a                                                   
largely inert mantle. However, P/Halley may not be typical and a wide variety                                                     
of coma morphology and time variable activity could exist among periodic comets.                                                  
For P/Giacobini-Zinner, the production rate of dust was much lower than that of                                                   
P/Halley, and the absence of prominent jets gave the appearance of a relatively                                                   
stationary and featureless coma. It should be noted, however, that as of this                                                     
writing, almost no effort has been made to enhance the images to bring out very                                                   
low contrast features. Ten-micron images of P/Giacobini-Zinner by Telesco et al.                                                  
(1986) and by Hayward and Grasdalen (1987) show variable structure of the type                                                    
that might be detected in the archived images after appropriate enhancement                                                       
procedures have been applied.                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                  
IV. IMAGE SELECTION CRITERIA                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                  
        Of the 218 images submitted for possible inclusion in the archive, 197                                                    
images (90%) met our selection criteria. These included (1) our ability to read                                                   
them as standard FITS files, (2) a significant signal, and (3) adequate spatial                                                   
resolution. The factors affecting the resolution included focussing, seeing,                                                      
and guiding. In all but five cases, the images were taken with CCD cameras of                                                     
various array sizes. These flat fielded images were not usually flux calibrated                                                   
and are thus in units of relative intensity. Users requiring photometrically                                                      
calibrated images are urged to contact the observers since many have standard                                                     
star frames but did not have time to go through the decalibration process. Five                                                   
digitized photographs are in units proportional to density.

of the extended NNSN FITS headers (including comments) and then combined with

was necessary to contact the observers in order to obtain missing information                                                     
or to clarify uncertain or ambiguous data. We proofread the headers several

follow up any apparent inconsistency they may find. After the images were sent                                                    
to the Lead Center, hard copy images were produced for the printed archive as

determine whether that image will satisfy their needs. All items are derived
