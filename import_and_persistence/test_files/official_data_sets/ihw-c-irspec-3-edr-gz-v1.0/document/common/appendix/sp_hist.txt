     The file HISTO.DAT contains data which can be used to generate  a        
histogram  of the number of spectra of comet Giacobini-Zinner archived        
by the International Halley Watch Spectroscopy  and  Spectrophotometry        
Center.   The  file  contains  two  columns  of  numbers, the first is        
(Julian Date - 2440000), the second is the number of  spectra  in  the        
archive  for that date.  Each day in the Julian Date interval, 2446145        
to 2446414, 20 March to 14 December 1985, is listed.   These  are  the        
inclusive dates covered by the comet P/Giacobini-Zinner data submitted        
by the IHW-SSN.  This file  was  written  with  a  FORTRAN  format  of        
3X,2I10.
