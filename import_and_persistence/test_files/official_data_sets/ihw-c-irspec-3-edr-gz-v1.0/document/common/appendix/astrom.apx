        A total of 1300 astrometric observations of comet Giacobini-Zinner that                                                   
cover the interval from January 28, 1984 through March 31, 1987, were reported                                                    
to the Astrometry Network of the International Halley Watch.  These observations                                                  
resulted from efforts by 199 observers working at 81 observatories throughout                                                     
the world.  Lists of the participating observers and observatories are given in

who were unfailing in their efforts to relay the data expeditiously.  At JPL,                                                     
the data were received, verified, and added to the master data file. Observa-                                                     
tions with orbit residuals smaller than three standard deviations (3-sigma) of                                                    
the root mean square (RMS) residual were given an accept code (A) and employed                                                    
in the weighted least squares differential correction procedure that was used                                                     
to update the comet's existing orbit.  Data with residuals greater than 3-sigma                                                   
were given a delete code (D) and, if they retained this code during subsequent                                                    
orbital updates, they were not included in these updates.  Data with residuals                                                    
exceeding 10 arcsec were not included in the master data file.  Once verified,                                                    
the data were put into the proper format (Sec. II) and added to the master data

not been relayed to us from there.  Updated orbital information was sent elec-

FITS standards.  BITPIX, NAXIS, NAXIS1 are integers (I) denoting, respectively,                                                   
the number of bits per pixel in the data record, the number of axes in the data

field (C) giving the name of the object.  FILE-NUM (I) begins with the integer

a unique sequential number used to identify the file.  DATE-OBS (C) and TIME-OBS

vatory and its geographic (geodetic) latitude (sdd/mm/ss).  When the geographic                                                   
latitude was not available, we computed it from the parallax factors listed in                                                    
each of our observation records. However, the parallax factors carry only enough                                                  
significant figures to allow the geographic latitude to be computed to a few

        SYSTEM (C) is the system code in which the leading digit (1) identifies                                                   
the Astrometry Network and the following three digits are a unique code for the

the Astrometry Network.  OBSERVER (C) gives the name(s) of the observer(s), last

Tables V and VI).  The observers are separated by a slash (/), whereas ET AL.

DAT-FORM (C) describes the format of the FITS data record which, for Astrometry,                                                  
is to be interpreted as logical records of 80 ASCII characters.                                                                   
                                                                                                                                  
        Following each FITS header record, there are five rows for each astro-                                                    
metric position reported.  The first line lists the time (Julian date in ephem-

the declination (deg, arcmin, arcsec).  The first character of the second line                                                    
is either an A or D, indicating whether the observation was accepted for, or                                                      
deleted from, the final orbit solution.  The second column of the second line                                                     
contains either a blank or a code indicating the image quality. This code--C, D,                                                  
S, and T--specifies whether the image is centrally condensed, diffuse, stellar,                                                   
or trailed.  An X code indicates that the observation is semi-accurate.  The                                                      
quality code is followed by the reported observation time (calendar date, UTC),                                                   
by the ET-UTC correction in tenths of a second (see Table VII), and by the right                                                  
ascension and declination that are corrected for the small effects of elliptic                                                    
aberration. The right ascension and declination are referred to the mean equator                                                  
and equinox of 1950.0.  Next on the second line is the observatory code (see                                                      
Table V) followed by the observatory's east longitude (deg) and by the parallax                                                   
factors used to convert the computed geocentric positions to the topocentric                                                      
observed positions.  The last two entries on the second line are the 1-sigma                                                      
standard deviations of the measurement noise (arcsec) for the right ascension                                                     
and declination; these values are used to form weights in the orbit determina-                                                    
tion process.  The third line in the data record contains the name(s) of the                                                      
observer(s), the name of the observatory, and the reported values for the total                                                   
and nuclear magnitudes.  When no magnitude was reported, a value of 99.0 fills                                                    
this field.  The fourth line in the data record begins with a reference which                                                     
specifies how, or from whom, the data were obtained.  The remainder of line four                                                  
and all of line five contain further information on the observation, including                                                    
any problems encountered, as well as additional observers involved whose names                                                    
were not listed on line three.  An example in Table III illustrates the five-
