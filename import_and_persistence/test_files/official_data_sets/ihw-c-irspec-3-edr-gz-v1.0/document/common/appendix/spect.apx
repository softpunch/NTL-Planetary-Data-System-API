          The 1985 apparition of comet P/Giacobini-Zinner became historical with                                                  
the success of the U.S. International Cometary Explorer (ICE), the first space-                                                   
craft mission to a comet.  On 11 September 1985, six days after perihelion, the                                                   
ICE spacecraft passed through the coma, approaching to within 7800 km of the

          The digital archive on the CD-ROM laser disk contains all of the                                                        
spectroscopic data of comet P/Giacobini-Zinner together with related appendices                                                   
and a table.  Each archived spectrum (one- or two-dimensional) consists of a set                                                  
of three files:                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                  
1.  A Planetary Data System (PDS) header -- a short header describing the data                                                    
    file, so that PDS software can be used to display the archived data.  Note                                                    
    that only minimal header information is included in this file.                                                                
                                                                                                                                  
2.  Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) header -- a longer header in FITS                                                      
    format (Wells et al. 1981).  The FITS header contains both standard keywords                                                  
    as well as keywords specific to the IHW-SSN. The FITS keywords are described                                                  
    below and in the digital files INTRO.TXT (this writeup) and CODE.*.  The                                                      
    purpose of the FITS header is to describe the data contained in the

    (IRAF) developed at the National Optical Astronomy Observatories (NOAO) can                                                   
    be used to display and analyze the FITS formated archive data.                                                                
                                                                                                                                  
3.  Data -- the data in the form of an integer byte stream are in the associated

been included in the digital version of the archive.  The appendices include                                                      
statistics on the number of spectra in the archive (HISTO.*), as well as this
