                  Observation Interpolation Program                           
                                                                              
                                                                              
     The program OBSNTERP is an interactive, seven point Lagrange inter-      
polation program that will return ephemeris data for periodic comet Giacobini-
Zinner over the interval January 5, 1984 through May 27, 1987.  To run the    
program, type OBSNTERP <carriage return> and respond to the prompts.  The     
executable requires a math co-processor.  The Fortran source code is given in 
the files labeled with the extension .FOR and the ephemeris data table for    
comet Giacobini-Zinner is EPHEM.TAB.  You can speed up the interpolation time 
by shortening the data table to include only the interval that you require and
by requesting output for dates in chronological order.  The information in the
data table was generated with IHW orbit number 37, which was based upon 1145  
astrometric positions over the interval March 11, 1972 through March 31, 1987.
(Each line of the table is a fixed width of 110 characters plus <CR> <LF>.)   
                                                                              
                                                                              
     The definition of each output quantity is given below:                   
                                                                              
     Date:    Calendar date and Julian date (times in these ephemerides are   
              universal times).
