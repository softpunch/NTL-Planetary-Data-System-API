This compact disc (CD-ROM) of IHW data on comet P/Giacobini-Zinner is the     
result of the dedicated efforts of many individuals and institutions.  Thanks 
go, perhaps most obviously, to the astronomers around the world who "joined"  
the IHW and who contributed their data, much of it in advance of publication. 
                                                                              
The list of such contributors is much too large to provide here, and in any   
case would duplicate observer/institution information provided in various     
indices and FITS headers already contained on the disc.  Nonetheless, as a    
group, it is a pleasure to thank the IHW observers here.                      
                                                                              
The archiving steps following the submission of data by the various IHW       
Discipline Specialists to the (IHW) Lead Center, and preceding the mastering  
of the total dataset for deposit on CD-ROM, are what are collectively known   
as either "CD-ROM data preparation" or, in IHW parlance, "Lead Center Work".  
Whichever of these terms one cares to use, the following individuals worked   
long and diligently to produce this disc, and it is fitting to cite them here:

                    E. Grayzeck (UNIV OF MARYLAND AND NASA/GSFC)              
                    D. Klinglesmith (NASA/GSFC)                               
                    A. Warnock (NASA/GSFC)                                    
                                                                              
The support of the National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC) at NASA/GSFC is 
gratefully acknowledged, in particular that rendered by J. King.  It was at   
the NSSDC's CD-ROM premastering workstation that this disc was assembled,     
and it was Dr. King who gave his assent to much of our work at NSSDC.         
                                                                              
We thank the management of the NASA/GSFC Laboratory for Astronomy and Solar   
Physics (LASP) for allowing the use of generous amounts of magnetic disk space
as a "staging area" for (final) file transfer to the NSSDC premastering       
workstation.  Special thanks go to LASP's E. Sullivan, whose voice was        
instrumental in making these arrangements.                                    
                                                                              
The undersigned would like to make special mention of C. Tart, the procurement
officer at NASA/GSFC who worked extremely diligently in the contract selection
exercise for IHW CD-ROM mastering services.
