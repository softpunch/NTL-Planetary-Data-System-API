***** File PATHTABL.TXT                                                       
                                                                              
     The PATHTABL.* files document the full volume and subdirectory           
specification for each file on this disc.  The table itself (PATHTABL.IDX) is 
a delimited table, with fields for filename, extension and version number,    
date and time of observation, volume name and five subdirectory levels.  Only 
non-blank values in the subdirectory fields contribute to the path            
specification for a file.  No delimiters are included in the fields for       
separating subdirectory levels, as the character to use is operating system   
specific.                                                                     
                                                                              
     The version number is in a separate (numeric) field.  Some CD-ROM drivers
(such as the Microsoft Extensions under MS-DOS) ignore the version number when
accessing the disc.  Others (e.g., Unix) append the version number as a       
required part of the file name.  In any event, the version number is coded on 
the disc, and is so documented in the path table.  Its value is always "1" on 
these discs.
