    This CD-ROM contains observations of comets Crommelin and Giacobini-      
Zinner (P/G-Z).  The observations of P/Crommelin were made between August 9,  
1983 and May 27, 1984.  The observations of P/G-Z were made between January   
28, 1984 and March 31, 1987.  In the table below are the file counts for the  
two comets:

Note: 24 of the 118 LPSN files of P/G-Z are included in digitized form, both  
      as compressed (full resolution) images and browse (reduced resolution)  
      images (the remaining 94 LSPN files are dataless FITS header files,     
      merely indicating the existence of these observations).
