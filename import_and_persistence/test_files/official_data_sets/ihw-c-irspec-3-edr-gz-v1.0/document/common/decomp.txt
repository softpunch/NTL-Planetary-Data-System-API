    An MS-DOS program (PCDECLSP.EXE) based on the previous pixel algorithm    
is included in the SOFTWARE directory.   It reads the header and decompresses 
the associated data file.  The output is a FITS file with minimal header.  A  
complete FITS header can be reconstructed by using the original extension     
header which carries information about the compression technique as well as   
the original astrometry keywords and processing comments.
