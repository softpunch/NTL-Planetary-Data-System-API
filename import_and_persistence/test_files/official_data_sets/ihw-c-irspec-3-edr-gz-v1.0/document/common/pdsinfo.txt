                               PDS LABELS                                     
                                                                              
                                                                              
     The International Halley Watch agreed early on in the project that       
all data would be submitted from the individual disciplines to the Lead       
Center using the FITS format.  When the decision was made to distribute       
this information on CD-ROM, it was determined that the data had to have       
even broader accessibility.  For this reason, the original FITS files,        
with contiguous headers and data, were split into separate files. The         
original FITS byte stream could then be recovered by concatenating the        
appropriate header and data files.                                            
                                                                              
     In addition, detached PDS labels were constructed to allow parallel      
definition of the data files for the Planetary Data System. The SPIDS         
(Standards for the Preparation and Interchange of Data Sets, Martin, T.       
Z., et al, Document D-4683, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California             
Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA) document version 1.1 was the           
primary reference to the Object Description Language (ODL) necessary to       
create the PDS labels.   (We thankfully acknowledge the help of M. Martin,    
JPL, for assisting the IHW through this exercise.)                            
                                                                              
     There are five fundamental data classes in this archive: IMAGE,          
TABLE, TEXT, LABEL, and SPECTRUM.  Our aim was to construct a basic PDS       
label for each data file on the CD-ROM. These PDS labels contain pointers to  
the actual data files (or to headers describing data submitted to             
the archive). There has been no effort to duplicate the documentation         
contained in the full FITS headers because the PDS and FITS headers for       
a given data file differ only in the filename extension.  Instead we          
have attempted to use the power of the PDS label syntax to fully              
describe the data structures and thus gain access to the powerful             
software already supported by that group.                                     
                                                                              
     The basic PDS descriptors such as SFDU_LABEL, RECORD_TYPE,               
RECORD_BYTES, and FILE_RECORDS are explained in the SPIDS document. The       
RECORD_TYPE for all data files is FIXED_LENGTH.   With guidance, the          
TABLE, LABEL, TEXT, and IMAGE descriptors were easily constructed.  In        
creating the labels for these data classes, we found good correspondence      
between FITS and PDS syntax, e.g., for tables the value of NAXIS1 =           
ROW_BYTES, NAXIS2 = ROWS, and TFIELDS = ROW_COLUMNS.  We shall not            
describe the columns in the tables until this experimental CD is              
evaluated.                                                                    
                                                                              
     We have conformed with the PDS definition of a specific keyword to       
indicate the presence of a FITS header (the keyword LABEL_FITS) when the      
"data" object is another header or LABEL.  The TEXT object (the               
Astrometry data) is an 80 byte fixed length record that contains only         
ASCII values.                                                                 
                                                                              
     In the case of images, we have included a new keyword describing         
the byte ordering of the data (MSB_INTEGER) required by FITS.  The PDS        
description of images in terms of LINES (FITS keyword NAXIS2) and             
SAMPLES (FITS keyword NAXIS1), given knowledge of the SAMPLE_BITS (FITS       
keyword BITPIX), was easy for the split files.  The final form of the         
label for compressed images is still under active discussion.  Unlike         
previous PDS efforts with compressed images, we chose not to compress         
the header (or label) and thus have included a keyword to describe the        
type of compression (ENCODING_TYPE = "PREVIOUS PIXEL") used. The label        
for compressed images also contains information to permit software to         
skip over the data if the decoding algorithm is unknown (ITEMS,               
ITEM_TYPE, and ITEM_BITS).                                                    
                                                                              
     We have attempted to use the ODL to indicate various subclass            
structures for the data objects.  An example of this is the DIFFERENCE        
modifier applied to IMAGE, yielding the keyword DIFFERENCE_IMAGE, which       
indicates that a processing step was applied to the original image.           
Finally, the SPECTRUM class description was recently refined by working       
closely with the PDS group to ensure definition of data groups that           
included both uniformly spaced data (as a single array) as well as            
ordered pairs of observation (POSITION_SPECTRUM).                             
                                                                              
     Following the recently proposed guidelines for dealing with the          
SPECTRUM data structure, we consider the spectra as tabular data              
(COLUMN_NAME, COLUMN_TYPE, COLUMN_BITS) which may be binary. The              
independent variable (WAVELENGTH) is described by the keywords                
SAMPLING_PARAMETER_NAME, SAMPLING_PARAMETER_INTERVAL, SAMPLING_               
PARAMETER_UNIT, and MINIMUM_SAMPLING_PARAMETER.  (A special                   
case for the Radio Studies data uses Doppler VELOCITY.)  One last             
exception is a table from the Infrared Studies Network of ordered             
triples of data, in which we interpreted the column of signal/noise           
ratios as an associated error.  A NOTE about this nonstandard use is          
included in the labels for the appropriate datasets.  We have also            
attempted to use the NOTE keyword to identify the contributing IHW            
discipline, subnet, and generic comments about the data.
