This directory and its contents have been copied over from the HAL_0024 disk  
unaltered, with the following exceptions:                                     
                                                                              
  1. The CROMMELN/ subdirectory has been deleted as irrelevant (it is         
     included in the data sets targetting Comet Crommelin); and               
  2. This file has been added.                                                
                                                                              
Files that relate directly to the orginal CD structure will be of limited     
usefulness, as that directory structure was not preserved in this data set.   
The CDTREE.TXT file, however, does have very brief descriptions for many      
of the other files in this directory.  The INTRODUC.TXT and GZGUIDE.TXT       
files may also prove helpful in getting an overview of the sort of data       
included and problems that might be encountered with formats.

This directory contains several different types if index into the contents    
of the original HAL_0024 disk, which contained observations of both Comets    
Crommelin and Giacobini-Zinner.  It is included as documentation rather than  
indices because the directory structure of that volume is not reproduced in   
the present data set; but there are useful tables showing key FITS header     
values across the entire archive, and any named file can be found fairly      
intuitively be noting the observation date listed here and following the      
hierarchy under the DATA/ directory (where one exists) for the particular     
data set in question.
