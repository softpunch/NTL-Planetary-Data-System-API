;   IMAGE is shifted right by one (16-bit) element, then subtracted           
;   from the original to obtain an array of differences. Absolute             
;   differences less than 128 are represented by the (byte) difference        
;   between pixels. The value 127 is added to each difference to make         
;   the value unsigned. Differences greater than 127 are flagged by           
;   inserting the byte value 255 (FF hex) in the array, followed by the       
;   original 16-bit pixel value, in consecutive bytes. Following FITS         
;   convention, the 16-bit numbers are byte swapped relative to DEC           
;   hardware.
