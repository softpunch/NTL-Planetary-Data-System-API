                         TCCLIB 2.0

This upgrade to TCCLIB is most likely the end of my dabbling in 
the adventurous world of Shareware.  I believe I had a good and 
worthy product in the original version, but though hundreds have 
downloaded it, only three have paid to use it in its first year.

Therefore, I am releasing this upgrade for TCCLIB and all source 
code to the public for free use.  I want it to be of benefit to 
as many programmers out there as possible.  I do at the same time 
maintain rights to the source code for the purpose of keeping 
anyone from selling these routines as his or her own work.  It is 
my desire for these routines to help out as many people as 
possible.  

I disclaim all liability for damage, either to hardware or 
software, caused by their use.  These routines are provided with 
source code, under the assumption that all who use them will do 
so intelligently and responsibly.  As far as I know, there are
no bugs or problems in any of them.  

Many of you will want to modify these routines to suit your needs
or to make them better.  You may even wish to sell your improved
versions.  The only condition I would set is that your improved
version of the routine be substantially improved or changed in 
some way, so that it not be basically a copy of my routine with 
only minor or insignificant changes.

Please feel free to pass these files around; in fact, I encourage 
it.  However, all files must remain together when they are 
distributed.
