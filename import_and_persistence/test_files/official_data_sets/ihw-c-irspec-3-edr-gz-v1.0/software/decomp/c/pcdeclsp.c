/******    PROGRAM PCDECLSP.C                                                 
                                                                              
                                                                              
This program reads in a compressed FITS image, decompresses it and writes it  
out as a legitimate FITS byte stream.  It reads and writes the FITS records as
streams of 2880 bytes.                                                        
                                                                              
NOTE:  The FITS header and associated data are assumed to be in SEPARATE      
       files.                                                                 
                                                                              
If no file name is specified on the command line, the program will prompt for 
one.  If only one name is given on the command line, it is assumed to be the  
input file, and the output file will be given the same file name except that  
the extension will be set to '$$$'.  If two names are given on the command    
line, the first is taken as the input file, the second as the output file.    
The data file is assumed to have the extension .IMQ, but this can be changed  
by specifying a third file name on the command line.
