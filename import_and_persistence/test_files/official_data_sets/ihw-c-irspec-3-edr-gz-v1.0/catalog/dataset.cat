    These data were archived under a very primitive form of the PDS           
    Standards (V1.0 and prototypes).  The original data set description,      
    if it ever existed, has been lost.  For most IHW data sets, though,       
    the data set description was generally a generic quote from the           
    CDROM volume set documentation.  The documentation from the original      
    HAL_0024 CDROM volume, which contained about two dozen data sets          
    of Giacobini-Zinner observations, is included in this data set under      
    the DOCUMENT/ directory.
