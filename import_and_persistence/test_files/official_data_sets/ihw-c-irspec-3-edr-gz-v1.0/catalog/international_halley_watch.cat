  ================                                                            
    The International Halley Watch (IHW) grew out of a National               
    Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) sponsored study               
    in 1979-80 (Brand, J.B., Newburn R., Friedman, L., 1980).                 
    The premise behind that study was that some form of                       
    cooperation among the astronomers and space scientists of                 
    the world would be necessary to make the most of the                      
    opportunity to study Comet Halley. In 1980 NASA organized a               
    Lead Center for the western hemisphere at JPL under Ray                   
    Newburn. A similar facility for the eastern hemisphere was                
    organized at Dr. Remeis Sternwarte, Bamberg, under Juergen                
    Rahe with the support of the government of the Federal                    
    Republic of Germany. Newburn and Rahe elaborated upon the                 
    plans of the original study group, which suggested                        
    appointment of specialists to set up networks of observers                
    in each of the major observing disciplines, establishment of              
    an international oversight committee, coordination with the               
    planned space projects, and cooperation with amateur                      
    observers.                                                                
                                                                              
              In 1981 a Steering Group of 22 scientists                       
    residents from 12 countries was appointed by NASA to help                 
    establish the other parts of the IHW and to advise on its                 
    operation. Later this international group became independent              
    of NASA, elected its own chairman, and added and/or replaced              
    members as it felt necessary. The Steering Group selected                 
    Discipline Specialists based on formal proposals submitted                
    in response to a NASA letter, mailed worldwide, seeking                   
    cometary scientists to organize the observing networks,                   
    coordinate their activity, and later to assist in archiving               
    the resulting data. By the time of the 1982 IAU meeting a                 
    complete administrative organization was in existence,                    
    awaiting its acceptance and imprimatur by that worldwide                  
    group."

    The NASA study suggested that the goals of the IHW should be              
    the following: advocacy, coordination, standardization, and               
    an archive of all the data. Indeed the archive was not to                 
    replace the normal interpretation and publication in                      
    technical journals. Rather it was to complement those                     
    publications by establishing a comprehensive database                     
    suitable for further studies requiring reduced but                        
    uninterpreted data from observers.                                        
                                                                              
              The Archive of Periodic Comet Halley has been                   
    completed in a CD-ROM or digital version. The comet's                     
    reduced observations belong to one of the following
