===========================                                                   
                                                                              
This directory contains the PDS catalog files, used for loading the           
PDS catalog database, that are specific to the files in this dataset.         
Note that the original International Halley Watch archive was created         
under a very early version of the PDS Standards, and the catalog files        
that were included on the disk were in a very different format from           
those of the modern V3.8 standards.  The versions included here, mainly       
for completeness, were created by extracting the information from the         
PDS catalog database in spring of 2006.  No further attempt has been          
made to modernize them or update them.
