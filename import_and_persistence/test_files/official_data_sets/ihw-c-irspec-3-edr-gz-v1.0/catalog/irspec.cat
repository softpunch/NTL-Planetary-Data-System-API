    ===================                                                       
    Before comet Halley, the only infrared spectra of comets                  
    were circular variable filter (CVF) data longward of 2                    
    microns at resolving powers of 50 to 100, and some high                   
    resolution Fourier transform spectra (FTS) shortward of 2                 
    microns. Much new spectroscopy was won in the comet Halley                
    apparition. The many spectacular VEGA 1 spectra (with a                   
    resolving power of about 50) resulted in the discovery of                 
    several new molecules and provided spatial resolution within              
    the coma. Ground-based and airborne observers obtained many               
    spectra with resolving powers ranging from 50 to 500, and                 
    extending farther into the infrared than before.                          
                                                                              
         Infrared spectroscopy was in transition during the                   
    Halley apparition. Most spectroscopy employed scanning                    
    spectrometers, but new array detectors were changing                      
    infrared spectroscopy and imaging with enormous sensitivity               
    improvements. Early models of these spectrometers became                  
    operational as Halley appeared. Had Halley returned just a                
    few months later, we could have achieved much better                      
    sensitivities!                                                            
                                                                              
         The NASA Kuiper Airborne Observatory (KAO) flew                      
    numerous missions to observe comet Halley, including a                    
    special expedition to the southern hemisphere. It obtained                
    high resolution FTS observations (2.5-3.5 microns) and                    
    intermediate (5-8 microns) to long wavelength (15-60                      
    microns) spectra.                                                         
                                                                              
         There were not many simultaneous photometric and                     
    spectroscopic programs, although many observers saw to it                 
    that photometry supported specific spectroscopy. It seemed                
    just too hard for observers to coordinate different                       
    instruments, telescopes, and observing teams. However, there              
    is photometry near most of the spectroscopy, and in any                   
    event, the photometric and spectroscopic observations                     
    addressed different questions. There is extensive                         
    ground-based spectroscopy around the spacecraft encounter                 
    times.                                                                    
                                                                              
         In hindsight, more spectra in the 10-micron region                   
    would have been useful, particularly because the spectra                  
    that we do have show that the Halley silicates are different              
    from what we expected based on comets Kohoutek and West.                  
    Future comets have to be targeted for the 10-micron                       
    spectroscopy.

    =====================                                                     
         In the early 1980's, infrared studies of comets were                 
    still a relatively young field although observations had                  
    been made in the previous one and a half decades. These                   
    included broad-band photometric measurements, selected                    
    intermediate-resolution spectroscopy (resolving powers                    
    of 50-100), and some spatial measurements of infrared                     
    emission from the coma and tails (Wilkening 1982). The                    
    observations had established a base of information on the                 
    infrared properties of comets (primarily dust) by 1982 when               
    the IHW was organized. The number of telescopes with                      
    infrared capability and the number of infrared astronomers                
    had increased about tenfold in the previous decade, and                   
    infrared instrumentation had dramatically advanced. Thus it               
    was clear that a concerted effort of infrared observations                
    of comet Halley could help us learn much about comets.                    
                                                                              
         The IHW assigned all infrared (loosely defined as                    
    1-1000 microns) observations to the Infrared Studies                      
    Network. This meant that the IR Network had to deal with                  
    photometry, spectroscopy, polarimetry, and imaging.                       
    Obviously, these areas had somewhat different goals and                   
    problems, which were reflected in the organization of the                 
    observations and the data archiving.                                      
                                                                              
       Relatively few infrared astronomers had observed comets                
    extensively before the IHW. This put demands on them to                   
    become familiar with the issues and methods of cometary                   
    science, and sometimes raised questions about observing                   
    techniques (fortunately only rarely after the fact). Of                   
    course, it was an objective of the IHW to advocate and                    
    encourage comet science, and maybe we succeeded. Probably,                
    however, comet Halley itself and the accompanying excitement              
    deserve most of the credit for the present interest in                    
    comets.                                                                   
                                                                              
       Some of the data will probably not appear elsewhere, but               
    much of the material has been published in some form in the               
    scientific literature. However, even for published material,              
    the archive often contains unique data or information. For                
    example, some observers chose to publish averaged magnitudes              
    or fluxes of several observations taken in a night. When the              
    data were available, the archive includes all the                         
    measurements rather than just the averaged values. The                    
    archive also provides information about apertures, filters,               
    air masses, and miscellaneous material that might not be                  
    published.                                                                
                                                                              
       When photometry data appeared in the literature and the                
    authors submitted nothing to the IHW (a few cases), we                    
    entered the published data to make the archive as complete                
    as possible. In all these cases, the archive files contain                
    the references.                                                           
                                                                              
       Polarimetry files follow the same format as photometry,                
    that is, ASCII tables with wavelength (filter), polarization              
    magnitude, polarization direction, and ancillary                          
    information. Most of the data do not appear in digital form               
    in the published literature.                                              
                                                                              
       The spectroscopy and imaging files are usually in the                  
    STANDARD format FITS files. Since published spectroscopy and              
    image data appear largely in graphical form, the digital                  
    data in the archive are the unique resource in most cases.                
    Many image data sets contain calibration images and                       
    comparison star information.                                              
                                                                              
       To make the archive as complete as possible, we created                
    files for those dates when we knew of scheduled                           
    observations, even if we could not get the data. These files              
    contain keyword information and references to assist archive              
    users in tracking down material. The amount of missing                    
    material known to us is small (a few percent of all the data              
    taken, including photometry, spectroscopy, and imaging). Of               
    course, published material is not lost. However, the data in              
    digital form that the archive contains will be a resource                 
    for future researchers. We urge those who did not submit
