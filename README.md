NTL-Planetary-Data-System-API
=============================

The Planetary Data System API provides a common API to allow access to data across all PDS nodes. NASA has recorded over 100 terabytes of space images, telemetry, models and just about everything one can imagine from all the planetary missions from the past 30 years. The data stored is within NASAâ€™s planetary data system (PDS). The PDS databases have developed in a disparate fashion over the years with different architectures and formats for different scientific needs; thereby making acquisition of data problematic. This API addresses this problem to make the data more accessible by users of the data.
