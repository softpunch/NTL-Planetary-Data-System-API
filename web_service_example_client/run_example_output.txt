  Instrument Overview                                                         
  ===================                                                         
    The High Resolution Imager (HRI) consisted of a long-focal-length         
    telescope with a dichroic beam splitter, located in front of the focal    
    plane, that reflected visible (0.3 to 1.0 microns) light through a        
    filter wheel to a CCD for direct, optical imaging.  The beam splitter     
    transmitted the near-infrared light (1 to 5 microns) to a 2-prism         
    spectrometer.  For convenience, we considered these as two separate       
    instruments, HRIV and HRII, sharing the telescope since the two focal     
    planes operated in parallel asynchronously.                               
                                                                              
    The HRI telescope was a classical Cassegrain design with the following    
    parameters:                                                               
                                                                              
      Primary aperture        : 30.0 cm diameter, round                       
      Primary focal ratio     :  4.5                                          
      Secondary Obscuration   :  9.7 cm diameter, round                       
      Secondary magnification :  7.8x (net Cassegrain focal length 10.5 m)    
      Back focal distance     : 30.0 cm                                       
                                                                              
    The dichroic beam-splitter had equal transmission and reflection          
    occurring at about 1.05 microns.  The filter wheel contained two clear    
    apertures and seven filters.  Five of the filters were roughly 100        
    nanometers in bandwidth, centered at 450, 550, 650, 750, and 850          
    nanometers.  The shortest-wavelength filter was effectively a             
    short-wavelength pass filter starting at 400 nanometers and limited to    
    about 340 nanometers on the short end by the rapid decline in             
    beamsplitter reflectivity.   The longest wavelength filter was a          
    long-pass filter starting at 900 nanometers that used the CCD response    
    to define the long-wavelength cutoff at about 960 nanometers.             
                                                                              
    The detector was a 1024 x 1024 split-frame, frame-transfer CCD with       
    21-micron-square pixels, with each quadrant read out through a            
    separate amplifier.  The electronics allowed readout of centered          
    sub-frames in multiples of 2:  64x64, 128x128, and so on, with or         
    without rows of overscan.  Transfer time, to move the two halves of       
    the image from the exposing area to the two shielded areas, was about     
    5.2 milliseconds.  Readout time for a full frame was 1.8 seconds.         
                                                                              
    The HRIV instrument in full-frame 1024 x 1024 mode had the following      
    field-of-view characteristics:                                            
                                                                              
      Pixel Size     :   21 micrometers                                       
      Pixel FOV      :  2.0 microradians                                      
      Instrument FOV :  2.0 milliradians or 0.118 degrees                     
      Surface Scale  :  1.4 meters/pixel at 700 kilometers                    
                                                                              
    The three instruments on the flyby spacecraft, HRIV, HRII (High-          
    Resolution IR Imaging Spectrometer) and MRI (Medium-Resolution            
    Visible CCD), were mounted on a separate instrument platform              
    together with the star trackers.  The three instruments were              
    nominally co-aligned.                                                     
                                                                              
    For a detailed discussion of the instrument, see Hampton, et al.          
    (2005) [HAMPTONETAL2005].  This instrument overview was provided by       
    Dr. Michael A'Hearn, the principal investigator for the Deep Impact       
    mission.                                                                  
                                                                              
                                                                              
  Instrument Calibration                                                      
  ======================                                                      
    The HRIV instrument was calibrated by using in-flight data as well as     
    pre-launch data taken during thermal-vacuum tests (TV2 and TV4)           
    performed in 2002 and 2003.  The calibration of the HRIV instrument       
    was discussed in the 'Deep Impact Instrument Calibration' paper by        
    Klaasen, et al. (2006) [KLAASENETAL2006].                                 
                                                                              
    There is a 1/3-pixel, horizontal gap for a clocking phase between         
    the upper and lower halves of the CCD.  It was inserted by the            
    manufacturer to facilitate the simultaneous upward and downward           
    reading of the upper and lower quadrants.  The gap causes a               
    10 percent reduction in the sensitivity of the two central rows           
    (i.e., one row immediately above the gap and one below it).               
                                                                              
                                                                              
  Flight Performance                                                          
  ==================                                                          
    The HRIV instrument generally performed as expected during flight.        
    However, early images of stars indicated the HRI telescope was out of     
    focus.  An analysis showed the focus was forward of the CCD, so           
    bakeouts were performed in late February and early March 2005 to          
    improve the focus.  The bakeouts reduced the defocus from 1.0 cm to       
    0.6 cm, which caused the width of star images to decrease from about      
    12 pixels to about 9 pixels.  Star images continued to have a             
    three-fold symmetry (six points) resulting from the three-point           
    mounting of the primary and secondary mirrors.  Most of the expected      
    resolution can be regained by applying algorithms to deconvolve the       
    HRIV images as described in Lindler, et al. (2007) [LINDLERETAL2007].

    mission.                                                                  
                                                                              
                                                                              
  Instrument Calibration                                                      
  ======================                                                      
    The HRIV instrument was calibrated by using in-flight data as well as     
    pre-launch data taken during thermal-vacuum tests (TV2 and TV4)           
    performed in 2002 and 2003.  The calibration of the HRIV instrument       
    was discussed in the 'Deep Impact Instrument Calibration' paper by        
    Klaasen, et al. (2006) [KLAASENETAL2006].                                 
                                                                              
    There is a 1/3-pixel, horizontal gap for a clocking phase between         
    the upper and lower halves of the CCD.  It was inserted by the            
    manufacturer to facilitate the simultaneous upward and downward           
    reading of the upper and lower quadrants.  The gap causes a               
    10 percent reduction in the sensitivity of the two central rows           
    (i.e., one row immediately above the gap and one below it).               
                                                                              
                                                                              
  Flight Performance                                                          
  ==================                                                          
    The HRIV instrument generally performed as expected during flight.        
    However, early images of stars indicated the HRI telescope was out of     
    focus.  An analysis showed the focus was forward of the CCD, so           
    bakeouts were performed in late February and early March 2005 to          
    improve the focus.  The bakeouts reduced the defocus from 1.0 cm to       
    0.6 cm, which caused the width of star images to decrease from about      
    12 pixels to about 9 pixels.  Star images continued to have a             
    three-fold symmetry (six points) resulting from the three-point           
    mounting of the primary and secondary mirrors.  Most of the expected      
    resolution can be regained by applying algorithms to deconvolve the       
    HRIV images as described in Lindler, et al. (2007) [LINDLERETAL2007].
